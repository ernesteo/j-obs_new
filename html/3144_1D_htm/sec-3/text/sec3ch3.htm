				dust or sand must be (or have been) 6 mi (10 km) or less.<BR> Encode as DS or

				<B>07 - Dust or sand raised by wind at or near the station at the time of
				observation, but no well-developed dust whirl(s) (devils) or sand whirl(s), and
				no duststorm or sandstorm seen; or in the case of ships, blowing spray at the
				station</B>.<BR> Use code figure 07 if there is dust in the air, the wind is
				strong enough to be lifting more dust or sand at the time of observation and
				the visibility at the time of observation is 6 mi (10 km) or less. Do not use
				code figure 07 if there is a well-developed dust whirl (devils) or a duststorm
				or a sandstorm.<BR> Encode as BLSA or BLDU.<BR> <BR> <B>06 - Widespread dust is
				suspended in the air, not raised by wind at or near the station at the time of
				observation</B>.<BR> Use code figure 06 if there is dust in the air, but the
				wind at the time of observation is not strong enough to be lifting more dust
				into the air. This code figure may be used with any visi-bility, as long as
				there is dust in the air. <BR> Encode as HZ.<BR> <BR> <B>05 - Haze</B>.<BR>
				Code figure 05 is not restricted to the definition applied for reports of haze
				in the basic observation, but can be used if it is simply hazy, regardless of
				the visibility.<BR> Encode as HZ.<BR> <BR> <B>04 - Visibility reduced by smoke;
				e.g., veldt or forest fires, industrial smoke or volcanic ash</B>.<BR> If the
				smoke is coming from a great distance, it will be spread through a deep layer
				of the atmosphere. In this case use code figure 04 regardless of how much the
				visibility is restricted. If the smoke is coming from somewhere fairly close,
				then it will be pretty much layered in the lower atmosphere. In this case, the
				visibility has to be 6 mi (10 km) or less before code figure 04 is used. If
				smoke is the only weather or restriction to visibility in the basic U.S.
				observation, use code figure 04.<BR> Encode as FU<BR> <BR> </TD>

			 <TD><B>03 - Clouds generally forming or developing</B>.<BR> Use code
				figure 03 only if there are clouds at the time of the observation, but no other
				weather and both of these conditions exist: (1) The clouds must have increased
				or become more developed during the past hour (examples of this would be low
				stratus clouds forming at night, clouds moving into the area in advance of a
				frontal system, or cumulus clouds growing taller during the day); and (2) there
				is also some significant past weather to report.<BR> <BR> <B>02 - State of sky
				on the whole unchanged. This is the characteristic of the sky during the past
				hour</B>.<BR> Use code figure 02 if the sky is clear at the time of observation
				and it was also clear during the past hour. Also use code figure 02 if there
				are clouds at the time of observation, but there had not been any significant
				change in the clouds during the past hour.<BR> <BR> <B>01 - Clouds generally
				dissolving or becoming less developed. This is the characteristic of the sky
				during the past hour</B>.<BR> Use code figure 01 if the sky is clear at the
				time of observation, but there were clouds during the past hour. Use code
				figure 01 if there were clouds at the time of observation, but the clouds had
				dissolved or become less developed during the past hour. Some examples of this
				are low stratus clouds breaking up in the morning or cumulus clouds beginning
				to flatten in the afternoon.<BR> <BR> <B>00 - Cloud development not observed or
				not observable. This is the characteristic of the sky during the past
				hour</B>.<BR> Use code figure 00 if clouds were not observed during the past
