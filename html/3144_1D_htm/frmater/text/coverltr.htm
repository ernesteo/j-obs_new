    <P>Encl: (1) U.S. NAVY MANUAL FOR SHIP'S SURFACE WEATHER OBSERVATIONS</P>
    
    <P> 1. <U>Purpose</U>. The purpose of enclosure (1) is to provide U.S.
      Navy ships with the basic instructions for observing, recording, and
      encoding surface marine weather observations. This instruction has been
      completely revised and should be reviewed in its entirety.</P>
    
    <P>2. <U>Cancellation</U>. NAVOCEANCOMINST 3144.1C </P>
    
    <P>3. <U>Discussion</U>. Accurate and timely submission of environmental
      observations are basic to the development of oceanographic and
      meteorological forecasts and tactical indices used in support of fleet
      operations. Since the U.S. Navy may be committed to operations anywhere in
      the world, global observations of meteorological conditions observed by
      its deployed forces are required. In remote areas, particularly over
      oceanic areas where environmental data are notably sparse, weather
      observation data from Navy ships become particularly vital.</P>
    
    <P>The minimum requirements for taking and reporting environmental
      observations by Navy and Military Sealift Command (MSC) ships are
      prescribed in reference (a). Additional requirements are also promulgated
      in pertinent operation orders (OPORD), plans (OPLANS), and tasking
      (OPTASK) orders. These plans should be consulted to ensure ships are
      complying with fleet and operational commander orders. In addition,
      special weather reporting requirements by ships at sea in specific areas,
      particularly where tropical cyclones or other large scale disturbances are
      suspected or known to exist, will be occasionally promulgated by the
      cognizant area or force commander, or when requested by the supporting
      Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (NAVMETOCCOM) activity.</P>
    
    <P>4. <U>Action</U>. All U.S. Navy ships shall conduct a surface weather
      observation program as directed by references (a) and (b), and in
      accordance with guidelines contained in this instruction. Technical
      questions which arise on matters relating to weather observations should
      be referred to the Officer in Charge, Fleet Numerical Meteorology and
      Oceanography Detachment, 151 Patton Avenue, Asheville, North Carolina
      28801-5014. Message address is: FLENUMMETOC DET ASHEVILLE NC//00//, by 
      telephoning (704) 252-7865, or e-mail, fnmodoic@ncdc.noaa.gov.</P>
    
    <P>5. <U>Responsibility for the Manual</U>. Commander, Naval Meteorology
      and Oceanography Command (COMNAVMETOCCOM) is responsible for maintaining
      this manual. FLENUMMETOC DET Asheville is tasked by COMNAVMETOCCOM to
      provide the necessary technical assistance to keep the manual current with
      the latest observing practices and code changes. Problems noted with the
      manual should be directed to the detachment through the Commanding
      Officer, Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, Monterey,
      California.</P>
