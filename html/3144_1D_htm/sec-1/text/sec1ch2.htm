    <P><A NAME="12">1.2</A> <B><U>OBSERVATION PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS</U></B></P>
    
    <P><A NAME="121">1.2.1</A> <U>Purpose.</U> U.S. Navy ships are required
      to take and transmit surface weather observations to satisfy a variety of
      needs.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="122">1.2.2</A> <U>Observation Equipment.</U> All
      environmental observations taken by U.S. Navy ships shall be obtained
      using authorized equipment described in NAVMETTOCCOMINST 13950.1H.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="123">1.2.3</A> <U>Written Records.</U> All ships at sea are
      required to take regular observations unless exempted by competent
      authority. The written record of weather encountered by the ship provides
      a legal record for use in investigations of accidents and mishaps. It also
      serves as a convenient log for data disseminated within the ship.
      Additionally, the forms are permanently archived. They provide an
      invaluable historical record of weather data for uses such as developing
      climatology publications and data bases.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Where
      ships are steaming in company or in close proximity (generally within 10
      nautical miles), the Officer in Tactical Command (OTC) may designate one
      of the ships to report observations for the group.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Ships in
      port are required to continue regular weather observing and reporting
      unless there is a nearby U.S. manned weather reporting activity which
      meets existing reporting requirements. In port weather guard ship
      arrangements may be utilized for groups of ships at the discretion of the
      Senior Officer Present Afloat (SOPA).</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. When a
      ship is exempted by competent authority from taking observations, make a
      notation in the remarks section of the Meteorological Records Transmittal
      Form, CNMOC 3140/2DF, Part B. Indicate the authority who exempted your
      unit from taking observations, the designated guard ship(s) and effective
      dates/times exempted (i.e., IAW CTF FOUR ONE 221345Z NOV 96 USS SAGINAW
      (LST-1188) DESIGNATED WX GUARD SHIP EFFECTIVE 0001Z 23 NOV TO 2359Z 29 NOV
      96).</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="1231">1.2.3.1</A> <U>Observation Form.</U> All ships taking
      surface weather observations will use CNMOC Form 3141/3, available through
      the Naval Supply System, FSN 0108-LF-019-3000. The form is designed for
      use by all observers. There are two sections to this form, one for the
      recording of hourly (and special) observations, and the other for
      recording of three and six hourly encoded synoptic weather observations.
    </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="12311">1.2.3.1.1</A> <U>Part I - Ship Observation Code.</U>
      This format is designed to support both surface and aviation requirements
      with additional ship and sea data columns. The World Meteorological
      Organization (WMO) FM-15 (METAR) and FM-16 (SPECI) formats are used to
      record all surface weather observations taken. Ship aviation observations
      are taken and encoded for local dissemination (via phone, radio, message
      transmittal, etc.) to departments within the ship, to aircraft operating
      from the ships' deck, to other ships and aircraft in the operating area,
      and to shore activities supporting fleet operations. This data is also
      used to provide weather data for accident and mishap investigations.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="12312">1.2.3.1.2 </A><U>Part II Ship Synoptic Code.</U> The
      second part of CNMOC 3141/3 is formatted to encode the WMO FM-13 (SHIP)
      synoptic code. Data is encoded in Part II from observed data recorded in
      Part I, with some additional observed data required. Part II is encoded
      for dissemination via naval message.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="12313">1.2.3.1.3</A> <U>Column Organization.</U> Each code
      (ship observation, ship synoptic) is divided into numbered columns. These
      columns are divided to contain specific observed elements or portions of
      observed elements, each element can then be identified by a column number.
      Part II contains all columns of the WMO FM-13 (SHIP) synoptic code,
      although not all columns will require an entry by Navy observing
      personnel.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="12314">1.2.3.1.4</A> <U>Column Applicability.</U> There are
      minor observation requirements placed on Aerographer's Mates (AG) and
      Quartermasters (QM); therefore, not all columns will always require an
      entry. Some columns require an entry in certain types of observations and
      other columns require an entry only when an element is observed to be
      present. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="124">1.2.4</A> <U>Maintenance of Observation Forms.</U> An
      original and one duplicate of each day's observations are required. The
      duplicate may be a rewritten copy, a carbon copy, or a suitable photo copy
      of the original size form. The duplicate should be retained for a minimum
      of six months, or in accordance with the ship's records retention program.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="1241">1.2.4.1</A> <U>Mailing of Observation Forms.</U>
      Original observation forms (and barograph charts for ships with
      barographs) are mailed to:</P>

    <P>The Meteorological Records Transmittal Form, CNMOC 3140/2DF (Rev 4/95),
      FSN 0108-LF-005-0700, available through the Navy Supply System, is to be
      utilized when sending observation records to FLENUMMETOC DET Asheville.
      The previous months records shall be packed and mailed by the fifth day of
      the next month, or as soon as possible thereafter. There is no requirement
      to submit the Meteorological Records Transmittal Form on a monthly basis.
      The form is used only to forward observation forms filled out during
      underway periods.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Packing
      for Mailing.</U> Complete instructions for packing and assembling records
      for mailing are contained within CNMOC 3140/2DF and shall be followed.
      Pack the forms and charts flat (do not fold or roll the forms). These
      records are photocopied to provide weather data for litigation, research,
      and data base development. Folded or rolled forms degrades the quality of
      the records and causes extreme problems during processing for permanent
      archival.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <U>Record
      Classification and Mailing.</U> Unclassified observation records should be
      sent by first class mail. All classified records shall be properly packed,
      properly marked, contain downgrading instructions, and mailed in
      accordance with OPNAVINST 5510.1H.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="125">1.2.5</A> <U>Entries on Observation Form.</U> All
      entries should be made with a black lead pencil (No. 2). </P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Legibility
      of Entries.</U> CNMOC 3141/3 form is an official document and is the
      primary record of weather encountered by the ship. All entries must be
      neat and legible. Avoid write overs and partial erasures that confuse the
      legibility of the data entered. It is recommended that a folder or board
      be devised to protect the form between observations.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <U>Corrections
      Made Before Dissemination.</U> Corrections may be made by erasure of the
      erroneous data only if the data has not been disseminated by any means
      (phone, radio, message transmittal, etc.). Erase the erroneous data from
      all copies of the form and enter the correct data in black. (Note: When a
      carbon copy of the form is made, care must be taken to prevent carbon
      smudges on the duplicate copy. In such cases, it is advisable to insert a
      piece of paper or cardboard between the carbon and second copy of the form
      when erasing data from the original.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. <U>Corrections
      made in Part I after Dissemination.</U> If an error is discovered in
      encoded data after it has been disseminated by any means, the erroneous
      data may not be erased. Correct the error with a red pencil by drawing a
      line through the error and entering the correct data above it or on the
      next line. If space is insufficient, enter the correction in Column 14
      with appropriate identification; e.g., SLPRES 969. When possible,
      disseminate a correction immediately after detecting an error in the
      transmitted data. Use the same dissemination given the erroneous report.
      Do not send a correction if the data in error has been updated by a later
      report with the same or greater dissemination. If a correction is
      disseminated, enter &quot;COR&quot; in Column 14 followed by the time (to
      the nearest minute UTC) the correction was disseminated.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. <U>Corrections
      Made in Part II after Dissemination.</U> If an error is discovered in
      encoded data in the Ship Synoptic Message after it has been transmitted,
      the erroneous data may not be erased. Correct the error with a red pencil
      by drawing a line through the error and entering the correct data above it
      or on the next line. If space is insufficient, enter the correction in
      Column 72 with an appropriate identification; e.g., Nddff 12315. When
      possible, disseminate a corrected message immediately after detecting an
      error in a transmitted report. Use the same dissemination given the
      erroneous report. When a correction is disseminated, enter &quot;COR&quot;
      in Column 72 followed by the time of the synoptic observation in question,
      and the time (to the nearest minute Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)) the
      corrected message was disseminated.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. <U>Verification
      of Disseminated Data.</U> Exercise care to avoid disseminating incorrect
      data. Check all messages prior to dissemination. Recheck the observation
      and compare it to the disseminated data.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="126">1.2.6.</A> <U>Quality Control of Records.</U> The
      accuracy and completeness of entries encoded in both the Ship Observations
      and Ship Synoptic formats is important to all users of the data. On scene,
      the safety of ship and aviation operations depend on the accuracy of the
      observation. <U><B>The accuracy of the encoded observation your unit
      transmits directly contributes to the accuracy of weather analyses,
      forecasts and warnings your ship receives.</B></U></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Responsibility
      for Quality.</U> The individual taking the observation is ultimately
      responsible for the accuracy of the recorded elements. As manpower
      permits, observations should be rechecked by another qualified member of
      the watch team as soon as possible after the observation is recorded.
      Personnel should not be utilized to check the months observations before
      mailing for the sole purpose of submitting perfect records.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <U>Discrepancy
      Reports.</U> When observations are received at the Fleet Numerical
      Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FLENUMMETOCCEN), Monterey,
      California, they are processed and redistributed to other Navy activities
      and civil agencies. During processing, the report receives a vigorous data
      quality check for accuracy. When errors are detected, they are sorted by
      type and ship name. At the end of each month, FLENUMMETOCCEN prepares a
      discrepancy listing on transmitted ship synoptic observations, then
      forwards the requested reports to appropriate Naval Meteorology and
      Oceanography Command (NAVMETOCCOM) commands conducting fleet liaison
      visits and to fleet commanders. These reports show apparent weaknesses in
      encoding observations and areas that might need emphasis during liaison
      visits, refresher, and On-the-Job Training (OJT). Before final archival,
      transmitted observations eventually receive a final quality control
      cross-check with the Shipboard Surface Weather Observations Report, CNMOC
      Form 3141/3, submitted on a monthly basis to FLENUMMETOC DET Asheville.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="127">1.2.7</A> <U>Fleet Support.</U> When problems arise with
      observing equipment (barometer, barograph, anemometer, etc.) that cannot
      be solved by ship's personnel, assistance may be requested from the
      nearest NAVMETOCCOM activity outlined in NAVMETOCCOMINST 3140.1J (U.S.
      Navy Oceanographic and Meteorological Support Manual). Ships are
      encouraged to schedule visits to NAVMETOCCOM shore activities where
      additional training on observing techniques and procedures may be
      obtained.</P>
