    <P><A NAME="131">1.3.1</A> <U>General.</U> The timely transmission of
      weather data provides near real time information which is used immediately
      by NAVMETOCCOM centers for the production of weather analyses, enroute and
      aviation weather forecasts (WEAX/AVWX), optimum track ship routing (OTSR),
      fleet operating area (OPAREA) forecasts and weather warnings. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="132">1.3.2</A> <U>Message Classification and Minimize
      Procedures</U></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Security
      requirements and wartime communications doctrine on message
      classification, downgrading/declassification instructions, and message
      transmission under MINIMIZE conditions are contained in NTP 3 and NWP 4.
      <B> Weather observations are considered significant and should be
      transmitted during MINIMIZE when the following conditions exist</B>:</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
      Wind speeds in excess of 25 knots.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
      Sea state of 12 feet or greater.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
      Moderate or heavy precipitation.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
      Pressure change of 3 millibars or greater within the past 3 hours.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)
      Visibility less than 1 mile.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)
      Oceanographic observations as dictated by current operations.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)
      Volcanic activity producing volcanic ash.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Special
      care must be taken to properly classify observations. Most observations
      are classified due to location information. Declassification may be
      possible within days or weeks after the observation date. Fleet OPORDS
      should be consulted for proper observation declassification instructions.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="133">1.3.3.</A> <U>Message Address Procedures.</U> Two
      Collective Address Designators (CAD) have been established for use by all
      ships (USN, USNS, U.S. non-Navy) for reporting environmental observations.
      The appropriate CAD to use depends upon the operating area a ship is in as
      described below. <U>These addressees automatically receive your
      observation.</U> Ships should also consult fleet OPORDS which address
      theater-wide message addressee requirements. </P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U><B>OCEANO
      WEST</B></U><B>:</B> This CAD is to be used to transmit observations
      reported in the North Pacific, South Pacific, Persian Gulf, and Indian
      Ocean, including associated seas and basins; all areas south of 60S, and
      surrounding land areas. The cognizant authority for CAD OCEANO WEST is the
      Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NAVPACMETOCCEN). The
      addressees of CAD OCEANO WEST consist of the following:</P>

      degrees), and INFO <B>NAVLANTMETOC DET KEFLAVIK IC//00//</B> for all

    <P><A NAME="134">1.3.4</A> <U>Local Transmission.</U> The dissemination
      of surface weather observation reports within the ship or to other
      military forces in the operating area, are dictated by ship Standard
      Operating Procedures (SOP), fleet OPORD or OPTASK orders. Observation data
      is invaluable information used by the cognizant task group and/or staff
      oceanographer(s) to develop briefings and to issue forecasts and warnings.
      They also provide input essential to support fleet weapons systems,
      aircraft operations, boating, diving, search and rescue operations, and
      other shipboard evolutions.</P>
