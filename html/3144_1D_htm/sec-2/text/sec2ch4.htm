	 <P><A NAME="2-4-1">2.4.1</A> <U>Introduction</U>. This chapter contains
		procedures for determining horizontal surface visibility at or near sea level.
		Weather and obstructions to vision which affect visibility are also discussed
		in <A HREF="sec2ch5.htm">Section II Chapter 5</A>. Procedures and tables for
		encoding visibility in the synoptic report are contained in
		<A HREF="../../sec-3/text/sec3toc.htm">Section III</A>. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-1-1">(AG) 2.4.1.1</A> <U>Uniqueness of Instructions</U>.
		Because of the lack of fixed visibility markers some of the procedures and
		instructions in this chapter differ from instructions and procedures used at
		land stations.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-1-2">2.4.1.2</A> <U>Surface Visibility at Sea</U>. Surface
		visibility is the maximum distance that objects of known characteristics can be
		identified in one half or more of the horizon circle when viewed in a nearly
		horizontal plane from the point of observation to 6 feet/1.8 meters above the
		surface at the horizon (the furthest distance that can be seen around the
		ship). When the term visibility is modified by terms such as prevailing,
		sector, variable, unrestricted, etc., the term is still in reference to surface
		visibility.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-1-3">2.4.1.3</A> <U>Units of Measure</U>. Visibility
		observed from a ship is reported in nautical miles (NM) using the reportable
		values given in <A HREF="#tab2-4-1">Table II-4-1</A>. The visibility may be
		observed in meters or yards but must be converted to nautical miles for
		reporting.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-4-1-3a">a</A>. <U>Rounding to Reportable Values</U>. If the observed
		visibility is determined to be between two reportable values the visibility
		should be rounded down to the lower reportable value.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-4-1-3b">b</A>. <U>Limitations on Reportable Values</U>. Due to the
		curvature of the earth and the relative flatness of the ocean, the distance
		from the ship to the horizon with unrestricted visibility is limited. A maximum
		value for reporting visibility at sea has been set at 10 NM.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-1-4">2.4.1.4</A> <U>Point of Observation</U>. Visibility
		observations should be taken from as many points as necessary to give an entire
		view of the horizon and from a point as close to the surface as practical to
		get the most accurate observation of surface visibility; i.e., the visibility
		should not be observed from the signal bridge if it is possible to observe it
		from a lower level.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-2">2.4.2</A> <U>Visibility Aids</U>. Because of the ship's
		mobility, the surrounding environment is constantly changing while the ship is
		underway. This makes identification of permanent visibility markers impossible
		to construct. Therefore, the presence of possible visibility aids must be
		evaluated before each observation is taken. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-2-1">2.4.2.1</A> <U>Visibility Aids at Sea</U>. When
		available, the following aids should be utilized when observing visibility
		underway. </P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
		<U>Landmass (coastline or island)</U>. When the ship is operating near the
		coastline or in the vicinity of islands, the observer should check navigation
		charts or radar to see if the landmass is close enough to the ship to be used
		as an aid to determine visibility. Determine the direction and distance from
		the ship and the presence of prominent features from navigation charts, such as
		hills, towers, and cities/towns, etc.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		<U>Ships</U>. When other ships are in company, or transiting the area, the
		observer should determine their direction and distance from the ship (usually
		by radar) and use them as visibility aids.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. <U>Rain
		Showers</U>. Often, rain showers of moderate or heavy intensity will have
		clearly defined edges and can be used as visibility aids. These showers show up
		well on radar, making the direction and distance from the ship relatively easy
		to determine.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.
		<U>Horizon and Sea Surface</U>. When none of the above aids are present,
		observers must estimate visibility by judging the clarity of the line of the
		horizon (the line between sea and air) to determine if the visibility is
		unrestricted (6 NM or greater) or restricted (less than 6 NM) by an obstruction
		or weather occurring at the ship or at a distance.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-2-2">2.4.2.2</A> <U>Constructing Visibility Aids for Port
		and Anchorage</U>. When ships are anchored or moored import, a chart of easily
		identifiable visibility markers should be constructed and posted for use by the
		observer, bridge, and quarterdeck watchstanders. This chart will be
		particularly useful to the quarterdeck Officer of the Deck (OOD), as well as
		the boat Coxswain for determining visibility when boat operations are being
		conducted. All available aids must be used to determine the visibility as
		accurately as possible.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. As a
		minimum, the chart should extend 10 NM around the position of the ship with the
		ship as the center. The coastline may be highlighted and positions of landmarks
		such as towers, bridges, and prominent buildings should be identified along
		with their distance and direction from the ship.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. If other
		ships are anchored or moored within 10 NM, the name and position should be
		indicated along with distance and direction from the ship. When using other
		ships, periodic checks should be made since they could change position or get
		underway.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-2-3">2.4.2.3</A> <U>Visibility Aids at Night</U>. The most
		desirable visibility aids at night are <B>unfocused lights of moderate
		intensity</B>. The red and green lights of other ships are suitable as
		visibility aids. Focused lights such as search and signal beacons should not be
		used as markers due to their high intensity; however, when the distance to the
		beacon is known, their brilliance and clarity may serve as an aid in
		determining the visibility. On nights when the moon provides sufficient light,
		visibility aids discussed in paragraphs <A HREF="#2-4-2-1">2.4.2.1</A> and
		<A HREF="#2-4-2-2">2.4.2.2</A> should be used.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-3">2.4.3</A> <U>Observing Visibility</U>. To observe
		prevailing visibility the observer should use all aids available at the time of
		observation. Ensure that the direction and distance of markers are current at
		the time of observation. From a moving ship, relative positions of stationary
		objects can change significantly within a ten minute period and the relative
		position of another moving ship could change drastically in a short time.
		Ensure that the visibility determined by a marker is representative of the
		visibility in that sector, whether the visibility is uniform, or if it varies
		from sector to sector. Also, determine whether the visibility is fluctuating up
		and down, increasing, decreasing or steady during the period of
		observation.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
		<U>Uniform Conditions</U>. Under uniform conditions, the prevailing visibility
		is the same as the visibility that is determined in any sector of the horizon
		circle.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		<U>Nonuniform Conditions</U>. Under nonuniform conditions, the prevailing
		visibility must be derived from the differing sectors. Determine the visibility
		in each differing sector (sector visibility) and the degrees of the horizon
		circle in each sector. Take the sectors with the greatest visibilities and add
		the degrees in each sector until half or more of the horizon circle is
		obtained. The visibility of these sectors that is the lowest is then used as
		the prevailing visibility <A HREF="#tab2-4-1">(See Table II-4-1)</A>. Sector
		visibilities different from the prevailing visibility are reported as Remarks
		in Column 14. </P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.
		<U>Variable Conditions</U>. Under conditions where the visibility is below 3 NM
		and increases and decreases between values (variable visibility) during the
		observation, a mean visibility is determined. When it varies between two values
		with a reportable value in between, use the middle value as the prevailing
		visibility. When there is no reportable value between the extreme values of
		variability, the lower visibility value should generally be used as the
		prevailing visibility unless the higher visibility is considered to be more
		representative of conditions. The value of maximum and minimum visibility
		values observed are reported as Remarks in Column 14. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-3-1">2.4.3.1</A> <U>Use of Visibility Aids</U>. After
		visibility aids have been determined, they must be properly used to determine
		accurate surface visibility.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Use of
		Landmarks</U>. When using landmarks such as mountains, steep coastlines, large
		towers, etc., it is important to <B>use the base of the object</B> to judge the
		visibility in the direction of the landmark. The upper portion of tall
		landmarks can be seen from great distances but they don't give a true
		indication of surface visibility. (i.e., from an observation point at a height
		of 40 ft. the upper 1000 ft. of a 2000 ft. mountain can be seen 43 NM away.)
		Distant landmarks may be used to determine if an obstruction is present or
		whether the visibility is unrestricted. When landmarks are within 10 NM of the
		ship, the clarity of the base will determine if the visibility is greater than
		the distance to the landmark. If the base is obscured with the upper portion
		visible, the surface visibility is somewhat less than the distance to the
		landmark. <A HREF="#tab2-4-2">(See Table II-4-2)</A></P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <U>Use of
		Other Ships</U>. When using ships within 10 NM as visibility markers, the
		clearness of the ship will determine if the visibility is greater than the
		distance to the ship. If the ship is blurred or indistinct, the visibility is
		about the same as the distance to the ship. If a ship is not visible in the
		direction it was determined to be in, the visibility is somewhat less.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. <U>Use of
		Lights at Night</U>. When using lights as night visibility markers, make sure
		their distance is known and their height above the sea if possible. Lights from
		a ship of a known distance will indicate the visibility is at least as great as
		the distance to the ship and the brilliance of the lights can be used to
		determine if an obstruction is present. When using lights from land, the
		distance to the coast and location of the light source (i.e., city, hilltop,
		sea wall, etc.), should be known.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. <U>Use of
		the Horizon</U>. When no aids are present, visibility must be estimated by
		judging the horizon line. Judge the clearness of the horizon (the contrast
		between ocean and air). A sharp, clear horizon, indicates the visibility is
		unrestricted. A blurry horizon indicates the presence of an obstruction to
		vision. When there is little color contrast between ocean and air, care must be
		taken when determining if an obstruction is present. When it is determined that
		the visibility is restricted, the range of visibility must be estimated.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-4-4">2.4.4</A> <U>Column 7 -- Prevailing Visibility</U>.
		Enter the prevailing visibility in nautical miles using the nearest reportable
		value listed in <A HREF="#tab2-4-1">Table II-4-1</A> and as follows:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-4-4a">a</A>. When the prevailing visibility is estimated to be more
		than the distance to the farthest visibility marker, estimate the visibility to
		the nearest reportable value up to 10 NM.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-4-4b">b</A>. If visibility is halfway or less than halfway between two
		reportable values, enter the lower value; e.g., 6 1/2 and 6 1/4 miles are
		rounded down to 6 miles. If the visibility is more than halfway between two
		reportable values, report the higher value; e.g., 6 3/4 and 6 7/8 miles are
		rounded up to 7 miles.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-4-4c">c</A>. If the visibility is less than 3 miles and variable during
		the period of observation, suffix the average of all observed values with a "V"
		e.g., 2V and enter the range of variability in Remarks of the observation, e.g.
		VIS 1V3.</P>
