	 <P><A NAME="2-1">2.1</A><B> <U>GENERAL</U></B></P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-1">2.1.1</A> <U>Introduction</U>. This section contains
		instructions for entering observed data for each of the columns in Part I of
		CNMOC 3141/3 form. Each column contains a specific element or related elements
		of the observation. The ship observation code is a standardized format which
		satisfies Navy weather observation requirements.</P> 
	 <P>As explained in <A HREF="../../sec-1/text/sec1ch2.htm#12">Section I,
		Chapter 2, paragraph 1.2</A>, the observation becomes the legal record of the
		weather encountered by Navy ships on a scheduled and unscheduled basis. The
		data collected for each observation is used by many departments within the
		ship. Boating, vertical and fixed wing aircraft operations from the ship's
		flight deck, and other special evolutions, require routine weather observation
		data. Prompt notification of significant changes in the weather is therefore
		vital to an evolution's safe accomplishment.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-2">2.1.2</A> <U>Point of Observation</U>. Observations
		should be taken from as many points as necessary to give an entire view of the
		horizon and celestial dome.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-2-1">2.1.2.1</A> <U>Preparation for Night Observations</U>.
		When observing at night, the observer should wear darkness adaptation goggles
		or glasses for a period of 10 to 15 minutes prior to the observation. This will
		allow the observer's eyes to become accustomed to darkness. Allow as much time
		outdoors as practical to ensure that complete adaptation to darkness is made
		before determining if any weather is occurring or any obstruction to vision is
		present.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-3">2.1.3</A> <U>Observation Types</U>. The classification
		of observation types are described below. The required elements to be observed
		for each observation type are detailed in <A HREF="#tab2-1-1">Table
		II-1-1</A>.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-3-1">2.1.3.1</A> <U>Routine Observations (METAR)</U>.
		Routine (METAR) weather observations are taken each hour. Required elements are
		observed within the 15 minutes preceding the hour. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-3-2">2.1.3.2</A> <U>Special Observations (SPECI)</U>.
		Special observations (SPECI) are taken to report significant changes in weather
		elements that affect aircraft operations. Special observations can be taken to
		report changes in conditions significant to the ship's operations. They are
		also taken to record the weather conditions at the time of a significant event
		as listed below:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Aircraft
		mishap.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Collision
		at sea.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Man
		overboard.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Other
		incidents or occurrences specified in the ships standard operating procedures
		(SOP), or in the opinion of the observer or other competent authority (i.e.,
		CO, NAV, OOD, etc.), requires a written record of weather conditions at the
		time.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-4">2.1.4</A> <U>Beginning of New Forms.</U> A new CNMOC
		3141/3 form will be started at 0001 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) each day.
		The 2355-2359 observation will be the <U>first</U> observation of the new day.
		If Part I of the form is filled in before the day is over, continue logging
		observations on a new form. Ensure the second form's heading is filled out
		completely. Continue to make entries in column 90 and Part II on the first
		form. The following section gives instructions on entering general information
		necessary for entry on each CNMOC 3141/3 form.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-4-1">2.1.4.1</A> <U>Form Heading</U>. The heading consists
		of six parts, the date, month, and year, ship's callsign, ship's name, and the
		rate of the observer.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
		<U>Date</U> - Enter the date in UTC, i.e., the date will change at 0001 (UTC)
		when a new form is started (DD).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		<U>Month</U> - Enter the month as a three letter abbreviation (APR, AUG, etc.)
		(MMM).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.
		<U>Year</U> - Enter the four digits of the year (YYYY).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. <U>Call
		Sign</U> - Enter the ship's four letter call sign (DDDD).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. <U>USS or
		USNS</U> - Enter the ship's full name, ship type and hull number on each form
		used.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.
		<U>Aerographers Mate (AG) /Quartermaster (QM)</U> - Check the appropriate box
		for the rating of the personnel taking the observations. Check "OTHER" box if
		MSC personnel are taking the observation.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.
		<U>Observer's Initials</U> - The initials of the qualified observer responsible
		for taking the observation is entered in column 15 of the form. Observer
		qualifications are to be completed and documented in applicable Personnel
		Qualification Standards (PQS) or other local job qualification requirements
		(JQR).</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-1-5">2.1.5</A> <U>Ship Synoptic Code</U>. The WMO FM-13
		(SHIP) code is routinely encoded for message transmission at the standard
		synoptic hours of 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. Additional observation
		reports are transmitted at asynoptic hours of 0300Z, 0900Z, 1500Z, and 2100Z,
		in accordance with this instruction, applicable fleet operation orders (OPORD),
		operational tasking (OPTASK) orders, or at the discretion of the unit when
		unusual or significant weather phenomena are encountered. Transmission
		precedence assigned to these messages are in accordance with NAVOCEANCOMINST
		3140.1J. Complete instructions for encoding a synoptic weather report are
		contained in <A HREF="../../sec-3/text/sec3toc.htm">Section III.</A></P>
