	 <P><A NAME="281">2.8.1</A> <U>Introduction.</U> This chapter contains
		instructions for observing the apparent wind speed and direction, computing
		true wind data (speed, direction, gusts, squalls and shifts) and making entries
		on CNMOC Form 3141/3.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2811">2.8.1.1</A> <U>Wind Data at Sea.</U> The movement of the
		ship affects the wind speed observed by both the ship's anemometers and hand
		held anemometers (e.g., AN/PMQ-3). The wind direction is observed in relation
		to the ship's bow so that the wind direction in relation to true north is
		affected by the ship's direction. The wind speed and direction, with the affect
		of the ship's speed and direction, is the apparent or relative wind. The wind
		speed and direction, minus the affect of the ship's speed and direction, is the
		true wind. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2812">2.8.1.2</A> <U>Units of Measure.</U> Wind speed
		(including gust and squalls) are observed, computed, and reported in nautical
		miles per hour (knots), to the nearest whole knot. Wind direction is observed
		to the nearest whole degree and computed to the nearest ten degrees.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2813">2.8.1.3</A> <U>Accuracy.</U> Since true wind must be
		computed, the chance of committing an error is increased. True wind or
		estimates are one of the most important observations made by ships at sea since
		the data reported in the ship synoptic code is used as criteria for issuance of
		wind, storm, high seas warnings, and ship routing forecasts. Therefore, care
		must be taken whenever computing true wind data.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="282">2.8.2 </A><U>Observing Wind Data.</U> Wind data can be
		observed using the following methods. The order given is also the priority of
		use.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Wind data
		observed from the speed and direction indicators of the installed anemometer.
		Anemometers measure the apparent wind speed and indicate the apparent wind
		direction.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Use of a
		hand held anemometer.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Visual
		estimation of the true wind direction and speed. Visual estimation should be
		used only when the installed and hand held anemometers are inoperative or not
		available. When the wind data is visually estimated the true wind speed and
		direction are directly derived.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2821">2.8.2.1</A> <U>General Instructions for Using
		Anemometers</U></P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Ensure
		that the ship's course is on a steady track throughout the period of observing
		the wind. <B>Never observe the wind while the ship is turning</B>.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Observe
		the speed and direction for a two minute period noting the following:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		The predominant (average) wind speed.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		The peaks and lulls in wind speed, checking for gust and squall criteria.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		The predominant (average) wind direction.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
		The degrees of variability of the wind direction, checking for variability
		criteria.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)
		Wind shifts.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2822">2.8.2.2 </A><U>Use of Installed Anemometers.</U> Use of
		installed anemometers is the preferred method for observing wind. Wind data is
		taken from the indicator panel which provides both instantaneous speed and
		direction. When using an installed anemometer, the data observed should always
		be compared with the wind conditions as they appeared while other elements of
		the observation were observed outside. This is to ensure that the anemometer or
		indicator panel is not malfunctioning. If two anemometers are installed ensure
		that the windward anemometer is used.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2823">2.8.2.3</A> <U>Use of Hand Held Anemometers.</U> If
		anemometers are not installed, the installed anemometer is inoperative, or the
		data from it is in doubt, the hand held anemometer should be used.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The wind
		measuring set AN/PMQ-3 is a portable hand anemometer. It is a combination wind
		direction and speed indicator which indicates direction to 360&ordm; and speed
		from 0 to 60 knots. The speed indicator has two scales, graduated from 0 to 15
		knots and 0 to 60 knots.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. To use
		the hand held anemometer, choose an observation site on the windward side of
		the ship, as far upwind as possible, i.e., if the wind is from the stern go
		aft, from the bow go forward. Stand facing parallel to the ship's centerline
		and into the wind. Note: Unless the wind is blowing parallel to the ship's
		direction the wind will be at an acute angle while facing parallel to the
		ship's center line.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		Grasp the instrument by the handle and hold it in an approximately vertical
		position at arm's length with the sight at eye level.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Aim the instrument parallel to the ship's center line at an imaginary point on
		the horizon by aligning the center of the slot in the front of the sight with
		the center of the strip between the two slots on the rear sight.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		Press and hold the vane locking trigger. Note the reading on the 0-60 (upper)
		scale on the wind speed indicator. If the wind speed reading is less than 15
		knots as indicated on the 0-60 scale, press the range selecting trigger on the
		side of the housing (3B and 3C models) or handle (3 and 3A models) and observe
		the indication on the 0-15 scale. <B>CAUTION: The range selecting trigger
		should not be pressed if the initial observation of the wind speed indicator
		indicates a wind speed in excess of 15 knots. Mechanical damage may result due
		to the slamming of the pointer.</B></P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
		Note the motion of the wind vane as it moves between the extremes of
		variability. Release the vane locking trigger when the vane is in the position
		of the predominant (average) wind direction. Carefully lower and tilt the
		anemometer and note the wind direction reading on the direction dial. If the
		wind is being observed facing aft, the direction must be converted in relation
		to the bow, add 180&ordm; for directions from 0&ordm; thru 90&ordm;, subtract
		180&ordm; for directions from 270&ordm; thru 360&ordm;.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2824">2.8.2.4</A> <U>Visual Estimation.</U> Wind direction may
		also be observed by noting the direction from which ripples, small wave, and
		sea spray are coming. The direction is most easily found by sighting along the
		wave crests and turning 90&ordm; to face the advancing waves. The observer is
		then facing the true wind direction. The true wind speed may be estimated by
		noting the sea condition and referring to <A HREF="#tab2-8-2">Table
		II-8-2</A>.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
		<A HREF="#tab2-8-2">Table II-8-2</A> is based upon two assumptions which should
		be considered in arriving at an estimated wind speed:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		The wind has been blowing at a relatively constant speed and direction for the
		time indicated.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		The fetch area is unlimited.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Some
		factors which cause the wind speed estimation to be too low are:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		Winds which have rapidly increased.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Off-shore winds when within sight of land.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		Moderate or heavy precipitation smoothing the sea surface.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Some
		factors which will cause the wind speed estimation to be too high are:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		Waves running into shallow water.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		A decreasing wind speed.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. When the
		surface of the sea cannot be observed, the true wind will be determined from
		the apparent wind. Estimate the apparent wind direction (relative to the bow of
		the ship) to the nearest 10 degrees. Estimate the apparent wind speed to the
		nearest 5 knots by observing the effect of the wind on the ship's pennants or
		flags, smoke, and rigging on the windward side of the ship. Use
		<A HREF="#tab2-8-1">Table II-8-1</A> to estimate the apparent wind speed based
		on the effect of the apparent wind on the ship. With this basic information at
		hand (ship's course and speed, apparent wind direction and speed), compute the
		true wind.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="283">2.8.3</A> <U>Computation of True Wind.</U> There are three
		basic methods for computing the true wind. All three methods use the vectors of
		the apparent wind and ship's movement. These methods are the true wind computer
		method, the maneuvering board method and the plotting board method. All three
		produce accurate computations. Since the true wind speed is reported to the
		nearest knot and the direction is reported to the nearest ten degrees, accuracy
		is not a factor in choosing a preferable method. The maneuvering board and
		plotting board methods are about equal in computation time and ease of use, but
		plotting boards are not as commonly available as maneuvering boards. The True
		Wind Computer CP 264/U is the quickest and easiest method and should be used
		over the other two methods.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2831">2.8.3.1</A> <U>True Wind Computer Method.</U> The true
		wind computer consists of an oval base plate and a clear plastic compass rose
		fastened with a center pivot. The compass rose rotates and slides freely along
		the axis of the base plate. All computations are made directly on the computer,
		and solutions are read off of its scales. Directions for use are printed on the
		reverse side of the base plate.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2831a">a.</A> An example of using the computer for determining the true
		wind direction and speed is given as follows. Assume that the apparent wind is
		300 degrees and 18 knots, and the ship's course and speed are 080 degrees and
		16 knots.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		Slide the rotor disk along the ship's speed reference line until the center
		index of the rotor disk is opposite the ship's speed, (16 knots) and then
		rotate the disk until the ship's heading (080 degrees true on the compass rose
		of the rotor disk) is directly over the 000 degrees/360 degrees bearing radius
		of the base plate.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Using a grease pencil, plot a dot on the rotor disk at the point determined by
		the apparent wind (300 degrees true and speed 18 knots) utilizing the base
		grid.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		Slide the rotor disk to the zero of the ship's speed reference index (the
		center of the concentric circles of the base plate) and rotate the disk until
		the grease pencil dot, previously plotted, lies along the 000 degrees/360
		degrees bearing radius of the base plate. The true wind direction, 328 degrees
		can now be read directly off the rotor disk over the 000 degrees/360 degrees
		bearing radius of the base plate. The true wind speed, 17.5 knots, can now be
		read directly opposite the grease pencil dot by utilizing the ship's speed
		reference index.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The
		computer can also be used to determine a ship's course and speed required to
		produce a desired apparent wind. For example, assume that the desired wind
		direction is 5 degrees off the port bow and the desired wind speed is 40 knots,
		actual apparent wind is 300 degrees and 18 knots, present ship's course is 080
		degrees true, and present ship's speed is 16 knots.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 of the example in above <A HREF="#2831a">sub-paragraph
		2.8.3.1.a.</A> to find the true wind direction and speed of 328 degrees and
		17.5 knots.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Manipulate the rotor disk (by rotation and sliding along the 000 degrees/360
		degrees bearing radius of the base plate) until the grease pencil dot, the head
		of the true wind vector, is directly over the reference point on the base plate
		as determined by the given requirements of the desired apparent wind (direction
		at 5 degrees off the port bow and speed of 40 knots across the deck), utilizing
		the grid of the base plate.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		Read directly off the rotor disk the ship's course, 340 degrees true, which is
		directly over the 000 degrees/360 degrees bearing radius of the base plate.
		Read directly the ship's speed, 23.5 knots, opposite the center of the rotor
		disk, from the ship's speed reference index. This ship's course, 340 degrees
		true, and a speed of 23.5 knots, with the given true wind direction and speed,
		will produce the desired apparent wind of 5 degrees off the port bow and a
		speed of 40 knots across the deck.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2832">2.8.3.2</A> <U>Estimation Method.</U> When the wind is
		estimated <A HREF="#2824">(see paragraph 2.8.2.4)</A> the true wind speed is
		directly observed. The direction is figured by determining the direction from
		the bow that the true wind is blowing from, then adding the course of the ship
		to the wind direction relative to the bow. If the sum is greater than 360
		subtract 360 from the sum, e.g., the wind waves are coming from 320&ordm; (off
		the port bow) and the ship's course is 060&ordm;, 320 + 060 = 380&ordm;, 380 -
		360 = 020&ordm; true wind direction.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2833">2.8.3.3</A> <U>Computation Check.</U> No matter which
		method of computation is used to derive the true wind direction and speed, the
		observer should check the results by considering the following statements:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The true
		wind direction is always on the same side of the ship as the apparent wind
		direction, but farther from the bow than the apparent wind direction.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. When the
		apparent wind direction is abaft of the beam, the true wind speed is greater
		than the apparent speed.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. When the
		apparent wind direction is forward of the beam, the true wind speed is less
		than the apparent speed.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="284">2.8.4</A> <U>Gusts, Squalls and Wind Shifts.</U> Gusts and
		squalls are significant fluctuations in the true wind speed while wind shifts
		are significant changes in true wind direction. To report them use the
		following criteria:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="284a">a</A>. <U>Gust.</U> A rapid fluctuation in wind true speed with a
		variation of ten knots (five m/s) or more between peak and lull.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="284b">b</A>. <U>Squall.</U> A strong wind characterized by a sudden onset
		in which the wind speed increases at least 16 knots and is sustained at 22
		knots or more for at least one minute.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="284c">c</A>. <U>Wind Shift.</U> A change in true wind direction of
		45&ordm; or more taking place in less than 15 minutes.</P> 
	 <P>Note: It is difficult to observe gusts, squalls, and wind shifts since
		the only wind directly observable by the observer is the apparent wind. The
		ship's speed and heading will always affect the observation of true changes in
		wind speed and direction.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="285">2.8.5</A> <U>Column 3 Wind Direction.</U> Enter the true
		direction from which the wind is blowing, to the nearest 10 degrees using three
		figures. Directions less than 100 degrees shall be preceded with a zero, i.e.,
		Winds from due east shall be coded as 090.) </P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="285a">a</A>. When the wind is calm, enter "000" for the direction and
		"00" for speed.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="285b">b</A>. Enter the 2-minute mean direction when wind is variable
		(varying by 60&ordm; or more). In addition, if wind speed is greater than 6

	 <P><A NAME="286">2.8.6 </A><U>Column 4 Wind Speed.</U> Enter the wind speed
		in whole knots using tens and units. When the wind is calm (less than 1 knot),
		enter "00" for wind speed. When the speed is 100 knots or more, enter three
		digits for the observed wind speed (i.e., 112).</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="287">2.8.7</A> <U>Column 5 Wind Character.</U> AG enter G (for
		gust) or Q (for squall), as appropriate, followed by the peak speed of gusts or
		squalls observed in the 10-minute period prior to the actual time of

		2.8.4</A>.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="288">2.8.8</A> <U>Column 6 Variability.</U> Enter the
		variability of the wind direction in degrees. The direction must vary by
