    <P><A NAME="2111">2.11.1</A> <U>Introduction.</U> This chapter contains
      instructions for observing ice accretion and sea ice and contains only
      those instructions needed to encode data in the Ship Synoptic Code. A more
      detailed description of sea ice observation procedures and definitions are
      provided in the &quot;Ice Observation Handbook,&quot; produced and
      distributed by Naval Ice Center (NAVICECEN), Suitland. <B>If an extended
      period of ship operations is planned for the polar region, it is
      recommended that NAVICECEN Suitland be contacted to ensure environmental
      factors affecting ship safety and operations are considered.</B>
      Information on how to obtain services from NAVICECEN are contained in
      NAVOCEANCOMINST 3140.1J.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="21111">2.11.1.1</A> <U>General.</U> Ice accretion is the rime
      or clear (glaze) ice that builds up on the outside of structures of the
      ship. Sea ice is floating ice of land origin or of sea origin.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Ice
      accretion is observed by measuring its thickness, noting its origin and
      formation or break up.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Sea ice
      is observed visually noting its amount, arrangement, development or size.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="2112">2.11.2 </A><U>Ice Accretion.</U> Ice accretion forms
      when outer surfaces of the ship are below freezing and water droplets are
      suspended, falling or being blown in the air.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="21121">2.11.2.1</A> <U>Clear (Glaze) Ice.</U> When
      temperatures are between 32&#186;F (0.0&#186;C) and 25&#176;F (-4.0&#186;C)
      and dense fog, freezing rain or blowing spray is present, ice will form on
      outer surfaces of the ship. Clear ice forms slowly due to the relatively
      high freezing temperatures. This ice is hard and will form slowly.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="21122">2.11.2.2</A> <U>Rime Ice.</U> Rime ice forms best at
      temperatures nearing 14&#186;F (-10&#186;C) - (note that at temperatures
      colder than this value, it is unusual for there to be enough liquid water
      drops in the air to freeze, except for spray blowing up around the ship).
      Rime ice is generally whitish opaque ice that is relatively soft (similar
      to frost in a freezer). The water droplets freeze quickly upon contact
      with outer surfaces of the ship and catch air in between the drops. Rain
      is quite unusual with surface temperatures as cold as 14&#186;F, so rime
      ice generally will form from fog or blowing spray.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="21123">2.11.2.3</A> <U>Ice Formation</U> Ice accretion
      generally begins to form on wires, railings, masts and fittings that are
      exposed to the open air. Ice will begin to form on flat surfaces such as
      cat walks, weather decks, and bulkheads that are not affected by heating
      from inside the ship. Lastly, ice will form on decks and bulkheads which
      are heated by conduction from inside the ship.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="21124">2.11.2.4 </A><U>Observing Ice Accretion</U></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Determine
      Origin of Ice Accretion</U></P>

    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <U>Measurement
      of Ice Accretion Thickness.</U> In areas where the ice is generally
      uniform in thickness, chip the ice down to the ship's surface and measure
      its thickness in centimeters. Do this for several areas and average the
      thicknesses.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. <U>Determine
      Development or Decomposition of Ice Accretion</U></P>

      Ice present but not building up.</P>

      Ice building up slowly in the judgment of the observer.</P>

    <P><A NAME="2113">2.11.3 </A><U>Observation of Sea Ice.</U> Observe sea
      ice from a high position on the ship where the entire horizon may be
      viewed. </P>
    
    <P><A NAME="21131">2.11.3.1</A> <U>Ice Formed by the Freezing of Sea
      Water (Termed Sea Ice by WMO).</U> Because of its salinity, seawater does
      not begin to freeze until it reaches approximately -1.9&#186;C (28&#186;F).
      The higher the salinity, the lower the freezing point. The thickness and
      physical characteristics of sea ice vary greatly with its age and stage of
      development. Determine the following:</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
      Concentration, coverage, and arrangement of the ice.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Whether
      the ice is fast ice (ice attached to the shore), grounded in shallow
      water, or pack ice (ice which is free floating).</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The age
      and development of the ice as follows:</P>

      Frazil ice, fine spicules or plates of ice suspended in water.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
      Grease ice, a sludge of ice crystals which gives the surface a greasy
      appearance.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)

      Gray ice, ice 10-15 cm thick, rafts under pressure.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
      Gray-white ice, ice 15-30 cm thick, generally ridges under pressure
      instead of rafting.</P>

      Old Ice, ice that has survived at least one summer's melt. Has smoother

      direction, relative to true north, of the major ice edge.</P>
    
    <P><A NAME="21132">2.11.3.2</A> <U>Ice of Land Origin.</U> Ice that has
      been formed on land as a result of the compaction of snow into glaciers is
      frequently found in certain areas of the polar regions. In these regions,
      the glaciers flow to the sea and form ice shelves. The ice shelves calve
      off icebergs or ice islands. Because of their large mass and unusual
      strength, icebergs are a hazard to navigation. When ice of land origin is
      observed determine:</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The
      classification of the ice as follows:</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
      <U>Iceberg,</U> a massive piece of ice with more than five meters visible
      above sea level. About the size of a medium sized ship or larger.</P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
      <U>Bergy Bit,</U> a large piece of ice with more than one meter but not
      more than five meters visible above sea level. About the size of a small
      house or cottage.</P>
