	 <P><A NAME="291">2.9.1</A> <U>Introduction.</U> This chapter contains
		information and instructions for observing the condition of the sea and for
		making entries in columns E, F, and G of CNMOC Form 3141/3. Sea condition
		refers to wave action and is divided into two types of waves. These are wind
		waves (also referred to as sea waves) and swell waves. Both types have general
		properties in common and are observed in the same manner.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2911">2.9.1.1</A> <U>General.</U> Wind and swell waves are
		formed by the movement of the air (wind) over the sea surface. The friction
		between the air and the water transfers energy from the air to the sea. This
		energy moves through the surface layer as a wave. Theoretically, this energy
		moves as a sine wave. Due to continuous fluctuations in the speed and direction
		of the wind over an area, many separate energy waves are formed overriding each
		other (see Figure II-9-1). Many properties of sine waves still apply to the
		waves observed in the natural environment.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Wind
		Waves.</U> Wind waves are those formed by the wind in the local area. The
		direction of a wind wave will always be the same as the direction of the local
		winds.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <U>Swell
		Waves.</U> Swell waves are those waves not raised by the local winds blowing at
		the time of observation, but which are due to winds blowing at a distance or
		from winds that have ceased to blow.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2912">2.9.1.2</A> <U>Properties of Waves.</U> Wind and swell
		waves have the following properties in common.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Wave
		Height.</U> Wave height is the vertical distance from the top of the crest to
		the bottom of the trough. Wave height is observed in feet.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		<U>Average Wave Height.</U> The average wave height is the estimated heights of
		the larger, well formed waves, usually the highest one-third of all waves.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.
		<U>Period.</U> The period of a wave is the time interval in seconds for
		successive wave crests to pass a fixed point.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="292c_1">(1)</A> The average period of all the swell waves is the period
		reported for swell waves.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="292c_2">(2)</A> The average period of the larger, well formed wind waves
		is the period reported for wind waves.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.
		<U>Frequency.</U> The frequency of waves is the number of waves passing a given
		point during 1 second. It is the reciprocal of the period. In general, the
		lower the frequency, the higher the wave; the larger the frequency, the smaller
		the wave.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. <U>Wave
		Length.</U> The wave length is the horizontal distance between two successive
		crests or from a point on one wave to the corresponding point on the succeeding
		wave. Wave length is measured in feet, and it is found by the formula: L =
		5.12T2. T being the period of the wave.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="292">2.9.2</A> <U>Wave Observations</U>. Wind and swell waves
		are observed by visual estimation. Measured wind speed data can be used as an
		aid when estimating wind waves. The following elements are recorded for wind
		and swell waves.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. For wind
		waves determine the average wave height and period.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. For swell
		waves determine the average wave height, period and direction from which the
		swell is coming.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Report
		swell waves when:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		The swell direction differs from the wind direction by 30 degrees or more,
		or</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		The swell period differs from the wind wave period by 4 seconds or more.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		Any additional swell systems must differ in direction from both the wind
		direction and each evaluated swell direction by 30 degrees. In most
		circumstances, only one swell system can be distinguished.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2921">2.9.2.1</A> <U>Observation of Wave Height.</U> The
		observation of wave height from aboard ship is complicated by the rolling,
		pitching, rising and falling of the ship with the waves. <B>There is a tendency
		to underestimate low waves and overestimate the heights of high ones</B>.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The best
		wave height estimate can be obtained by observing another ship in company. The
		height from trough to crest of a wave against the ship's side can be estimated
		as a part of some known vertical distance. For example, a wave might be 1/4 of
		the bridge height of 28 feet, or 7 feet high.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. When no
		other ships are in company the height(s) must be determined by the wave action
		on the side of the ship or near the ship.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		Observe wind waves on the windward side of the ship as close to the water line
		as possible.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Observe swell waves on the side of the ship from which the swell is coming.
		When the ship is running into the swell, observe it from the windward side of
		the ship (this is the optimum condition to observe swell wave height). As with
		the wind wave height, the swell wave height should be observed as close to the
		water line as possible.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		When the wave lengths are shorter than the length of the ship (generally all
		wind waves are, but some swell waves may be longer) estimate the wave height by
		looking over the side and notice the distance between the wave crests and
		troughs on the ship's side.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
		For wind waves, note the heights of the well formed waves and average the
		heights.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
		For swell waves, note all waves that are not confused by the wind waves and
		average the heights.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
		If the ship is rolling and pitching excessively, or is in a turn or running
		across a high swell, the wave action along the side of the ship should not be
		used to determine wave height. Judge the waves near the ship and estimate the
		average height of the wind waves and the average height of all the swell waves
		in each swell train present.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. When
		determining the height of the wind wave always consider the true wind at the
		time of observation and the prevailing wind that has blown in the past several
		hours. Use <A HREF="#tab2-9-1">Table II-9-1</A> as a guide to determine the
		minimum fetch area and duration time for the estimated wave height to become
		fully arisen for a given wind speed. If the duration time is limited, use
		<A HREF="#tab2-9-2">Table II-9-2</A> to determine the estimated wave height
		that would arise at the wind speed for the length of time the wind has been
		constant in speed and direction. <B>The heights derived from these tables
		should be used only as a guide while estimating wind wave heights because the
		actual heights may differ from the table values for many reasons. The observed
		wind wave height cannot be higher than the height that can be produced by the
		wind speed that has been occurring in the fetch area</B>.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2922">2.9.2.2</A> <U>Observation of Wave Period.</U> The
		average period of the wind waves and the average swell waves are determined by
		timing the passage of successive wave crests past a fixed point.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Point
		of Observation.</U> The period of waves should be observed from a relatively
		high position on the ship so the wave crests are looked down upon to more
		easily distinguish well defined wave crests.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		<U>Determination of Wave Period.</U> Look out away from the ship so that the
		waves are oncoming. If possible, locate a stationary floating object such as a
		clump of seaweed, a patch of foam or floating debris. When the object reaches
		the apex of a wave crest, start timing until the object reaches the apex of the
		next wave crest. Do this about 15 times, then average the times to determine
		the period. Repeat this procedure for each train of swell waves present.
		<A HREF="#tab2-9-1">Table II-9-1</A> contains the range of periods normally
		found for given wind wave heights.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2923">2.9.2.3</A> <U>Observing Wave Direction.</U> The
		direction from which the swell waves are coming is determined for each swell
		wave train present.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Point
		of Observation.</U> The swell wave direction should be observed from a
		relatively high position on the ship so that a large area of the sea is visible
		and the swell wave train can be seen moving as a whole. </P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		<U>Determination of Direction.</U> Face into the swell waves so that a right
		angle is formed between the swell and an imaginary line running from the point
		of observation to the horizon. Determine the degrees of the angle formed by the
		imaginary line and a line running from the ship's bow going clockwise from the
		bow. Add the degrees to the direction of the ship, if the sum is greater than
		360&deg;, subtract 360&ordm; from the sum; i.e., the swell is 280&ordm;
		clockwise from the ship's bow, the ship's course is 180&ordm;, 280&ordm; +
		180&ordm; = 460&ordm; - 360&ordm; = 100&ordm;. 100&ordm; is the direction from
		which the swell wave is coming. The ship's compass located on the bridge (or
		bridge wing) can also be utilized to establish wave direction.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="293">2.9.3 </A><U>Wave Observations at Night.</U> When
		observing waves at night, the observer should wear darkness adaptation goggles
		or glasses for a period of 10 to 15 minutes (as long as possible) prior to the
		observation. This will allow the observer's eyes to become accustomed to
		darkness. Allow as much time outdoors as practical to ensure that complete
		adaptation to darkness is made before the sea condition is observed. If the sea
		surface cannot be seen sufficiently owing to extreme darkness or low visibility
		due to weather phenomena, and the observer feels that a wave observation cannot
		be accurately estimated, omit the wave groups. It is better to report no wave
		data than to report incorrect wave information based on a poor estimation.</P>

		significant wind waves in feet.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="295">2.9.5 </A><U>Columns F and G - Swell Waves, Direction,
		Period and Height.</U> Enter the hundreds and tens of degrees of the direction
		and average period of the swell waves in seconds from which the primary swell
