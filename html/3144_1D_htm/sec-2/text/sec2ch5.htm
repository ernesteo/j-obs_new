	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		<U>Tornado</U>. A violent rotating column of air, forming a pendent, protruding
		from a cumulonimbus cloud, and touching the ground. It nearly always starts as
		a funnel cloud and is accompanied by a loud, roaring noise (+FC in column
		9).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)

		Direction toward which the phenomenon moved or is moving.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Although
		QM personnel are not required to take Special Observations (SPECI) to report

		an observation be taken to document their existence near the ship.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-5-2-2">2.5.2.2</A> <U>Thunderstorm Activity</U>. Observe and
		report thunder and lightning activity during its occurrence according to

	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
		<U>Thunderstorm</U>. One or more sudden electrical discharges, manifested by a
		flash of light (lightning) and a sharp or rumbling sound (thunder). It is a
		local storm associated with a cumulonimbus (CB) cloud and is usually
		accompanied by strong gusts of wind, heavy rain, and sometimes hail. For
		reporting purposes, <U>a thunderstorm is considered to have begun and to be
		occurring "at the ship" when thunder is first heard.</U> It may also be
		considered as occurring when hail is falling or lightning is observed in the
		immediate vicinity of the ship and the local noise level is such that resulting
		thunder cannot be heard. <U>A thunderstorm is considered as ended 15 minutes
		after the last occurrence of the above criteria.</U> A thunderstorm may be
		encoded by itself, i.e., a thunderstorm without associated precipitation, or it
		may be coded to describe the character of precipitation, i.e., TSGS would be a
		thunderstorm with small hail.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		<U>Lightning</U>. A luminous manifestation accompanying a sudden electrical
		discharge which takes place from or inside a cloud. Four main types of
		lightning are distinguished. When lightning is observed, determine for each
		storm center the frequency (i.e., "frequent" or "occasional"), type (e.g.,
		in-cloud, cloud to ground, etc.) and the location with respect to the ship. See
		<A HREF="#tab2-5-3">Table II-5-3</A> for lightning type and frequency
		definitions.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Determine

	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		The time of beginning, ending, or both, to the nearest minute.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Location of each storm center with respect to the ship, to include distance in
		nautical miles if known. If available, use radar to determine the distance(s)
		of thunderstorms and CB's visible at a distance from the ship.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		Direction toward which the storm is moving (or moved), if known.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
		Frequency, type, and location of lightning (if observed). Location need not be
		reported when it is the same as the thunderstorm with which it is
		associated.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-5-2-3">2.5.2.3</A> <U>Precipitation</U>. Observe and report
		precipitation during its occurrence according to special observation criteria
		established in <A HREF="sec2ch2.htm">Section II, Chapter 2,</A>
		<A HREF="sec2ch2.htm#tab2-2-1">Table II-2-1</A> and <A HREF="#tab2-5-2">Table
		II-5-2</A> Remarks, and as follows:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
		<U>General</U>. Precipitation is considered as occurring at the ship based on
		fall directly affecting any part of the ship, as detectable from the
		observation site.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <U>Type
		and Character of Precipitation</U>. Determine the type and character of
		precipitation forms primarily on the basis of experience, with consideration
		given to knowledge of the synoptic situation.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		<U>Rain</U>. Precipitation of liquid water particles, in the form of drops
		larger than 0.02 inch (0.5 mm) or smaller drops which, in contrast to drizzle,
		are widely separated.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		<U>Freezing Rain</U>. Rain that freezes on impact with the ground or with
		objects in flight or on the ground.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		<U>Drizzle</U>. Fairly uniform precipitation composed exclusively of fine drops
		(diameter less than 0.02 inch or 0.5 mm) very close together. Drizzle appears
		to float while following air currents although, unlike fog droplets, it falls
		to the ground.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
		<U>Freezing Drizzle</U>. Drizzle which freezes upon impact with the ground or
		with objects in flight or on the ground.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)
		<U>Snow</U>. Precipitation of ice crystals, mostly branched in the form of
		six-pointed stars.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)
		<U>Snow Pellets</U>. Precipitation of white opaque grains of ice. The grains
		are round or sometimes conical. Diameters range from about 0.08 to 0.2 inch (2
		to 5 mm). Snow pellets are brittle and easily crushed; and, when they fall on
		hard ground, they bounce and often break up. They generally fall together with
		snowshowers or rainshowers when the surface temperature is near 32&deg;F
		(O&deg;C). They may occasionally fall from stratocumulus.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)
		<U>Snow Grains</U>. Precipitation of very small white and opaque grains of ice.
		The grains are fairly flat or elongated. Diameters are generally less than .04
		inch (1 mm). When the grains hit hard surfaces they do not bounce or shatter.
		They usually fall in very small quantities from stratus clouds (or occasionally
		from fog).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)
		<U>Ice Pellets</U>. Precipitation of transparent or translucent pellets of ice,
		which are round or irregular, rarely conical, and have a diameter of 0.2 inch
		(5 mm) or less. The pellets usually rebound when striking hard surfaces and
		make a sound on impact. They are divided into two main types, based primarily
		on character.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
		<U>Type (a)</U>: Hard grains of ice consisting of frozen raindrops or largely
		melted and refrozen snowflakes (formerly sleet). This type falls as continuous
		or intermittent precipitation.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
		<U>Type (b)</U>: Pellets of snow encased in a thin layer of ice which has
		formed from the freezing either of droplets intercepted by the pellets or of
		water resulting from the partial melting of the pellets. This type falls as
		showers.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)
		<U>Hail</U>. Precipitation of small balls or other pieces of ice (hailstones)
		falling separately or frozen together in irregular lumps. Hailstones consist of
		alternate opaque and clear layers of ice in most cases. Hail is normally
		associated with thunderstorms and surface temperatures above freezing.
		Diameters generally range from 0.2 to 2.0 inches (5 to 50 mm) or sometimes
		more.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)
		<U>Ice Crystals</U>. A fall of unbranched (snow crystals are branched) ice
		crystals in the form of needles, columns, or plates. They are termed "Ice
		Prisms" in synoptic observations. Ice crystals are often so tiny that they seem
		to be suspended in the air. They may fall from a cloud or from clear air. The
		crystals are visible mainly when they glitter in the sunshine or other bright
		light (diamond dust), thus producing a luminous pillar or other optical
		phenomena. This hydrometeor (rarely more than the lightest precipitation),
		which is frequent in polar regions, occurs only at very low temperatures in
		stable air masses.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)
		<U>Continuous and Intermittent Rain, Freezing Rain, Snow and Ice Pellets
		Type</U>. These are normally associated with nimbostratus and altostratus
		clouds, but may also occur with stratocumulus and (rarely) altocumulus.
		Rainshowers, snowshowers, and ice pellet showers are associated with
		cumuliform-type clouds such as cumulonimbus and towering cumulus. Hail falls
		exclusively as showers; and, snow pellets almost always fall as showers.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)
		Drizzle, freezing drizzle, and snow grains are associated with stratus clouds.
		Ice crystals are associated with cirroform-type clouds or clear skies (common
		primarily to polar regions at very low temperatures); the character of fall is
		generally continuous.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(13)
		For reporting purposes, only the predominant character is determined for a
		specific type. For example, if both continuous and showery snow are falling and
		the showers appear to be predominant, only the showery character is reported.
		This condition is common to cumulonimbus imbedded in nimbostratus and with
		occluded fronts.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.
		<U>Precipitation Intensity</U>. Intensity of precipitation is an indication of
		the amount of precipitation falling at the time of observation. It is expressed
		as light, moderate, or heavy. Each intensity is defined with respect to the
		type of precipitation occurring; based either on rate-of-fall for rain and ice
		pellets or visibility for snow and drizzle. The rate-of-fall criteria are based
		on time, and do not accurately describe the intensity at the time of
		observation. For this reason, <A HREF="#tab2-5-4">Tables II-5-4</A>,
		<A HREF="#tab2-5-5">II-5-5</A>, and <A HREF="#tab2-5-7">II-5-7</A> should only
		be used as a guide to estimate the intensity at the time of observation.
		<A HREF="#tab2-5-6">Table II-5-6</A>, on the other hand, is based on the
		visibility at the time of observation, and must be used to determine intensity
		of drizzle or snow, if either is occurring alone. If snow or drizzle are
		present with other obscuring phenomena, <A HREF="#tab2-5-8">Table II-5-8</A>
		should be used as a guide to determine intensity.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.
		<U>Hailstones</U>. During occurrence and following the end of hail, obtain the
		diameter of the largest hailstone. Determine hail size in inches and fractions
		of an inch. In reports of hail, include the time of beginning, ending, or both,
		to the nearest minute, when required. Report hail according to special
		observation criteria established in <A HREF="sec2ch2.htm">Section II, Chapter
		2,</A> <A HREF="sec2ch2.htm#tab2-2-1">Table II-2-1</A> and <A
		HREF="#tab2-5-2">Table II-5-2</A> Remarks. </P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.
		<U>Significant Changes</U>. Observe and report significant changes in
		precipitation conditions. Significant conditions are those involving the
		occurrence (beginning and ending) of hail, ice pellets, ice pellet shower,
		freezing rain, and freezing drizzle, to include changes in their intensity
		(i.e., except Hail). Normally, the beginning and ending of other types must
		also be reported. However, a change from one type to another (e.g., rain
		changes to snow) and the beginning or ending of one type while another is in
		progress (e.g., rain and snow changes to snow) need not be reported as a
		significant change.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-5-2-4">2.5.2.4</A> <U>Obstructions</U>. Observe and report
		obstructions during occurrence according to <A HREF="sec2ch3.htm">Section II,
		Chapter 3</A>.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. An
		obstruction is considered as occurring when the phenomenon restricts the
		visibility to 6 NM (10 km) or less. The phenomenon is considered as occurring
		"at the ship" based on its apparent existence, as detectable from the
		observation location. Determine the specific type of obstruction based on
		observer experience and the definitions provided below.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <U>Types
		of Obscuring Phenomena</U>. Determine the specific type based on experience and
		on the guidance provided with the following definitions.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		<U>Fog</U>. The common term used to identify a suspension of minute water
		droplets in the air, generally reducing the horizontal visibility at the
		earth's surface. Specific terms used to report fog conditions are defined as
		follows:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
		<U>Ship Observations</U>:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Fog</U>.
		The fog condition that reduces horizontal visibility to 6 NM (10 km) or less
		and the vertical depth of the phenomenon is approximately 20 feet (6 meters) or
		greater. Shallow fog (MIFG), patches (of) fog (BCFG), and partial fog (PRFG)
		may be encoded even when prevailing visibility is 7 miles or greater.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Ground
		Fog</U>. A fog condition that reduces horizontal visibility to 6 NM (10 km) or
		less and vertical depth is less than 20 feet (6 meters). This is a local
		phenomenon, usually formed by radiational cooling of the air. When the
		occurrence does not clearly fit this definition, the condition should be
		classified as fog (vice ground fog).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
		<U>Synoptic Observations</U>:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Fog</U>.
		The fog condition that reduces horizontal visibility to less than 0.55 NM (1
		Km).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Freezing
		Fog</U>. A fog condition that reduces horizontal visibility to less than 0.55
		NM (1 Km), and the water droplets are freezing upon contact with exposed
		objects to form a coating of rime and/or glaze. This condition can occur even
		though the air temperature is above freezing.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Mist</U>.
		A fog condition that reduces horizontal visibility to 6 NM (10 km) or less but
		not less than 0.55 NM (1 km). Water droplets may or may not be freezing upon
		contact with the exposed objects.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		<U>Freezing Fog</U>. The suspension of numerous minute ice crystals suspended
		in the air, based at the earth's surface, which reduces horizontal visibility
		(similarly as specified with fog above). Ice fog does not produce rime or glaze
		on cold exposed objects. Temperatures are usually at or below -20&deg;F
		(-29&deg;C) when ice fog forms. However, a mixture of liquid and ice fog
		occasionally forms at temperatures below freezing. This condition may persist
		for a few hours as the fog changes to ice fog and dissipates due to a drying of
		the air, even though temperatures continue to fall. Optical effects similar to
		those associated with ice crystals are observed in ice fog (diamond dust,
		etc.). Temperature-dew point differences may approach 8F&deg; (13C&deg;) or
		more.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		<U>Shallow Fog</U>. A suspension of minute water droplets (or ice crystals) in
		the air which do not reduce horizontal visibility above a height of 6 feet (1.8
		meters). This condition may also be referred to as "shallow ground fog." For
		reporting purposes, the two terms are considered synonymous.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
		<U>Partial and Patches of Fog</U>. A suspension of minute water droplets (or
		ice crystals) in the air that has little vertical extent (normally greater than
		or equal to 6 feet but less than 20) which do not reduce horizontal visibility
		above a height of 6 feet (1.8 meters). This condition may also be referred to
		as "shallow ground fog." For reporting purposes, the two terms are considered
		synonymous.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)
		<U>Blowing Snow</U>. Snow particles raised and stirred violently by the wind to
		moderate or great heights. Visibility is reduced to 6 NM (10 km) or less and
		the sky may become obscured when the particles are raised to great heights.</P>
	 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)
		<U>Spray and Blowing Spray</U></P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
		<U>Spray</U>. Water droplets torn by the wind from a substantial body of water
		(generally from the crests of waves) and carried up a short distance into the
		air.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
		<U>Blowing Spray</U>. Spray raised in such quantities that it reduces the
		visibility at eye level (approximately 6 feet or 1.8 meters) to 6 NM (10 km) or
		less.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)
		<U>Haze</U>. A suspension in the air of extremely small, dry particles
		invisible to the naked eye and sufficiently numerous to give the air an
		opalescent appearance. This phenomena resembles a uniform veil over the ocean
		that subdues all colors. Dark objects viewed through this veil tend to have a
		dirty yellow or reddish hue. When haze is present and the sun is well above the
		horizon, its light may have a peculiar silvery tinge. Haze particles may be
		composed of a variety of substances; e.g., dust, salt, residue from distant
		fires or volcanoes, pollen, etc., which generally are well diffused through the
		atmosphere.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)
		<U>Dust</U>. Fine particles of dust or sand suspended in the air by a duststorm
		or sandstorm that have occurred inland and extend far out to sea. Dust gives a
		tan or gray tinge to distant objects. The sun's disk is pale and colorless, or
		has a yellow tinge through dust.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)
		<U>Smoke</U>. A suspension in the air of small particles produced by
		combustion. This phenomena may be present either near the sea's surface or in
		the free atmosphere. When viewed through smoke, the disk of the sun at sunrise
		and sunset appears very red. The disk may have an orange tinge when the sun is
		above the horizon. Evenly distributed smoke from distant sources generally has
		a light grayish or bluish appearance. A transition to haze may occur when smoke
		particles have traveled great distances (e.g., 25 to 100 miles or more) and
		when the larger particles have settled out and the remaining particles have
		become widely scattered through the atmosphere. </P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)
		<U>Blowing Dust</U>. Dust raised by the wind to moderate or great heights above
		the ground and blown out to sea that restricts horizontal visibility to 6 NM
		(10 km) or less. NOTE: The Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean are common areas
		where dust and/or sand are blown out to sea.</P>

	 <P><A NAME="2-5-2-5">2.5.2.5</A> <U>Volcanic Eruptions</U>. Volcanic
		eruptions shall be reported whenever observed. The entry shall be plain
		language and contain the following if known:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Name of
		volcano.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Latitude
		and longitude or the direction and approximate distance from the ship.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Date/Time
		(UTC) of the eruption.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Size
		description, approximate height, and direction of movement of the ash
		cloud.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Any other
		pertinent data about the eruption.</P> 
	 <P>Pre-eruption activity should not be reported. Pre-eruption refers to the
		unusual and/or increasing volcanic activity prior to a volcanic eruption.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-5-2-6">2.5.2.6</A> <U>Other Atmospheric Phenomena</U>.
		Observe and report other atmospheric phenomena using <A HREF="#tab2-5-2">Table
		II-5-2</A> as a guide and as follows:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
		<U>Auroral Phenomena</U>. When located north of 45&deg;N latitude, observe and
		report the occurrence of aurora according to
		<A HREF="../../sec-3/text/sec3toc.htm">Section 3</A> guidelines. An Aurora is a
		luminous phenomenon which appears in the high atmosphere in the form of arcs,
		bands, draperies or curtains. This phenomenon is usually white but may have
		other colors. The lower edges of the arcs or curtains are usually well defined
		while the upper edges are not. Polar aurorae are due to electrically charged
		particles, ejected from the sun, acting on the rarified gases of the higher
		atmosphere. The particles are channeled by the earth's magnetic field, so that
		aurorae are mainly observed near the magnetic poles.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-5-3">2.5.3</A> <U>Column 9 -- Present Weather Entries</U>.
		Enter present weather entries using symbols (plain language for volcanic
		activity), order of entry, and intensity signs in <A HREF="#tab2-5-1">Table
		II-5-1</A>. <U>Atmospheric phenomena must be occurring at the ship at the time
		of the observation</U>. Obstructions must restrict prevailing visibility to 6
		NM or less. Enter phenomena not occurring at the ship in Remarks of the
		observation. Precipitation, with no obstruction to vision present, can and
		usually does reduce visibility. Therefore, no assumption should be made that an
		obstruction to vision must be present with low visibilities.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-5-4">2.5.4</A> <U>Column 14 -- Remarks and Supplemental Coded
		Data Entries</U>. The order of entry for remarks in Column 14 and other coded
		data listed below should be followed. The remarks field shall be identified by
		the contraction <B>RMK</B>, followed by a blank space, and then remark
		information prioritized by category as follows:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-5-4a">a</A>. <U>Breaks in An Obscured Sky Condition</U>. Enter the

	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-5-4b">b</A>. <U>Other Remarks Elaboration on Preceding Coded Data</U>.
		Enter remarks significant to aircraft or ship operations. Any other remarks the
		observer considers significant may also be entered in this category, with the
		order of entry the same as the coded data to which the remark relates.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-5-4c">c</A>. Enter direction and location of phenomena in a clockwise
		order using the 8 Points of the compass in no more than 90&ordm; increments,
		e.g., N-E-SE. Increments for the 16 points of the compass may be used if
		considered necessary.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Report
		movement of clouds or other phenomena with respect to location and direction
		toward which the phenomena are moving.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Distances
		of phenomena should be based on a reliable method of determination; e.g., by
		means of radar or an aircraft pilot report. Phenomena between 5 to 10 nautical
		miles shall be reported as vicinity (VC). Anything beyond 10 nautical miles is
		considered distant (DSNT).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. Remarks
		pertaining to tornadic or thunderstorm activity may be combined with those for
		CB/CBMAM when the direction of movement is the same; e.g., TS VCNTY NE AND CB
		SW-W MOV E.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.
		<U>Synoptic Cloud Types 8/C<SUB>L</SUB>C<SUB>M</SUB>C<SUB>H</SUB></U>. Enter
		the three and six hourly synoptic cloud type. An "0" shall be encoded for low,
		middle or high cloud type if no cloud is present in that classification. A
		solidus "/" shall be encoded for layers above an overcast.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h.
		<U>Pressure Tendency 5appp</U>. The 5appp group shall be included in the 3 and
		6 hourly observations only when the ship is at anchor.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.
		<U>Sea-Level Pressure SLPppp</U>. The SLPppp group shall be included in the
		hourly observations. It is encoded using the tens, units, and tenths of the
		Sea-Level Pressure from column 22a, e.g., 998.2 = SLP982. If the sea-level
		pressure is not available, encode as SLPNO.</P>
