	 <P><A NAME="261">2.6.1</A> <U>Introduction.</U> This chapter contains
		observing and computation procedures for determining atmospheric pressure data
		and making entries on CNMOC 3141/3 form, columns 13, 22, and 22a.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2611">2.6.1.1</A> <U>General.</U> Atmospheric pressure is the
		force exerted by the weight of the column of air above the ship. It is measured
		by a precision aneroid barometer (ML-448/UM). Certain ships are authorized an
		allowance for the marine barograph (ML-563A/UM) as a backup capability.
		Pressure measurements and computations are used in the testing and calibration
		of equipment and operation of weapon systems and aircraft. Pressure values
		transmitted in the ship synoptic code are used in weather analyses from which
		weather forecasts and warnings are derived.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2612">2.6.1.2</A> <U>Distribution of Pressure Data.</U>
		Providing pressure data in the correct unit of measure using proper computation
		is important to the safety of those that use the data. Personnel requiring
		pressure data will often ask for the "Atmospheric Pressure," while having
		little or no knowledge of the various types of pressure computations or the
		different units of measure. Some pressure data is critical in their
		application. Therefore, the type of computation and unit of measure required
		should always be verified. If the requester is not sure of what data is
		required, have them determine what is required before providing a figure that,
		when used, may affect their safety, a pilot's safety, or the condition of the
		equipment or weapon system they are operating or servicing.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2613">2.6.1.3</A> <U>Units of Measure.</U> Atmospheric pressure
		is measured in two units, hectopascals (hPa) and inches of mercury (Hg). The
		hectopascal is the international unit of measure for atmospheric pressure and
		inches of mercury are used in the U.S. for aviation purposes. Note: Pressure
		was formerly reported as millibars (mb). The hectopascal is numerically
		equivalent to the millibar.</P>

	 <P><A HREF="#tab2-6-1">Table II-6-1</A> provides a convenient reference for
		conversion of hectopascals to inches of mercury (Hg).</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="262">2.6.2</A> <U>Pressure Measurement Definitions.</U>
		Atmospheric pressure is routinely determined for three basic values - station
		pressure, sea level pressure and altimeter setting. Values for pressure
		altitude (PA) and density altitude (DA) are determined for local use to support
		aircraft operations. The pressure change and tendency for three hours is
		determined for the synoptic report or when other certain criteria are met.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2621">2.6.2.1</A> <U>Station Pressure.</U> Station pressure is
		the pressure observed from the aneroid barometer, ML-448/UM (or marine
		barograph ML-563A/UM) with any instrument correction added. Station pressure is
		the base from which all other pressure values are derived. It is reported in
		inches of mercury (Hg) to the nearest 0.005 inch Hg.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2622">2.6.2.2</A> <U>Sea Level Pressure.</U> Sea level pressure
		is the atmospheric pressure computed to represent the pressure at mean sea
		level. This pressure reported from a ship is a pressure derived by adding to
		the station pressure a value representing the pressure exerted by the column of
		air existing between the barometer and sea level. Since this represents a
		relatively small section of the atmosphere, a constant value can be used for a
		given height. These values are called Additive Reduction Constants which are
		found in <A HREF="#tab2-6-2">Table II-6-2</A>.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2623">2.6.2.3</A> <U>Altimeter Setting.</U> This pressure
		setting is based on a standard atmosphere with the station pressure reduced to
		sea level. It is derived by adding to the station pressure a value representing
		the pressure exerted by the column of air existing between the barometer and
		sea level. As with sea level pressure (paragraph 2.6.2.2), constant values are
		also used for given heights. Additive reduction constants are found in
		<A HREF="#tab2-6-2">Table II-6-2</A>.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2624">2.6.2.4 </A><U>Pressure Altitude (PA).</U> Pressure
		altitude (PA) is a value representing the height above or below sea level that
		a given pressure would occur based on a standard atmosphere (standard
		atmosphere having a pressure at sea level of 29.921 inch Hg/1013.25 hPa). PA is
		reported in feet. When the computed sea level pressure is less than the
		standard atmosphere (29.921 inch Hg), PA is positive (pressure must be added to
		arrive at the standard atmosphere). When computed sea level pressure is greater
		than 29.921 inch Hg, PA is negative (pressure must be subtracted to get to
		standard atmosphere). <A HREF="#tab2-6-3">Table II-6-3</A> provides pressure
		altitudes for various sea level pressures. PA is computed with the Density
		Altitude Computer (CP-718/UM).</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2625">2.6.2.5</A> <U>Density Altitude (DA).</U> Density
		altitude (DA) is a value representing the height above or below sea level that
		a given density would occur based on a standard atmosphere (standard atmosphere
		having a density at sea level of .001225 grams per cubic centimeter). DA is
		reported in feet. When the actual density is greater than standard atmosphere,
		DA is negative. When the actual density is less than standard atmosphere, DA is
		positive. DA is also computed with the Density Altitude Computer
		(CP-718/UM).</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="263">2.6.3</A> <U>Observing and Computing Pressure
		Measurements.</U> Pressure measurements are determined using the method and
		instruments indicated below. <A HREF="#fig2-6-1">Figure II-6.1</A> is a sample
		pressure computation which utilizes the hourly pressure computation worksheet,
		<A HREF="#fig2-6-2">Figure II-6.2</A>. The computation worksheet may be a
		useful aid to standardize calculations for those ships not having pressure
		tables tailored for the ship's standard barometer elevation.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.
		<U>Aneroid Barometer.</U> Gently tap the glass face of the barometer with a
		finger, to reduce the effect of friction, until the pointer stops changing
		pressure when tapped.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(AG) b.
		<U>Marine Barograph.</U> Gently tap the top of the instrument case to reduce
		the effect of friction. Tap until the pen stops changing pressure when
		tapped.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. <U>Error
		of Parallax.</U> The observer's eye should be at 90&ordm; (perpendicular) to
		the face of the barometer so the pointer position can be ready with accuracy to
		a 0.1 tenth of a hPa. When the eye is perpendicular to the barometer face a
		mirror strip on the barometer helps the observer line up their eye to detect
		any reflection of the pointer. If there is a reflection, you are not lined up
		correctly. This is known as the "error of parallax."</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.
		<U>Pressure Tables.</U> Pressure tables can be developed for the ship's
		standard barometer elevation. When constructed properly, these tables reduce
		errors in routine computations and will save time while taking and recording an
		observation. Tables are constructed by adding the reduction constants to each
		station pressure observable and converting the values to hPa. The same thing
		can be done for altimeter settings, thus when computing sea level pressure and
		altimeter setting, enter the station pressure in the table and read the
		corresponding values for sea level pressure and altimeter setting. <B>Great
		care must be taken when preparing these tables to ensure no errors are induced.
		If errors occur, they will constantly produce errors when used</B>. In
		addition, if the barometer height is changed, the tables become useless and
		must therefore be redone to reflect the new barometer height. FLENUMMETOC DET
		Asheville should be consulted for technical assistance on construction of these
		tables.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2631">2.6.3.1 </A><U>Station Pressure.</U> Read the pressure
		indicated to the nearest 0.1 tenth of hPa (or 0.005 inch Hg) and convert the
		value to the equivalent inch Hg. Algebraically add any instrument correction to
		the observed pressure to determine the station pressure. This value is the
		station pressure.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2632">2.6.3.2</A> <U>Sea Level Pressure.</U> Compute the sea
		level pressure by first observing the station pressure. Add the additive
		reduction constant from <A HREF="#tab2-6-2">Table II-6-2</A> for the given
		station elevation. Convert the value from inch Hg to hPa. Recheck all
		computations.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2633">2.6.3.3</A> <U>Altimeter Setting.</U> Compute the
		altimeter setting by first observing the station pressure. Add the additive
		reduction constant from <A HREF="#tab2-6-2">Table II-6-2</A> for the given
		station elevation or use prepared tables discussed in <A HREF="#263">paragraph
		2.6.3</A>. Recheck all computations.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2634">2.6.3.4</A> <U>Pressure Altitude (PA).</U> Compute the
		pressure altitude (PA) by first computing the sea level pressure. Using the
		Density Altitude Computer (CP 718/UM), set the hairline cursor on the sea level
		pressure value represented on the Pressure in Millibars Scale. Read the PA
		where the cursor crosses the PA scale. Pressure altitude (PA) for the
		respective sea level pressure can also be found by using <A
		HREF="#tab2-6-3">Table II-6-3</A>. Be careful not to change the positive or
		negative sign of the PA value.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2635">2.6.3.5</A> <U>Density Altitude (DA).</U> Computation of
		density altitude (DA) involves several steps as follows: Observe the dry bulb
		temperature, compute the dew point, then compute the pressure altitude on the
		Density Altitude Computer (CP-718/UM). With the cursor on the PA, rotate the
		cursor and inner plate around until the cursor also crosses the air temperature
		on the temperature scale on the outer disc. The cursor should now lie on the
		sea level pressure, pressure altitude and the air temperature. Taking care not
		to let the inner or outer discs slide, rotate the cursor around to the window
		in the inner disc. Set the cursor on the dew point temperature and read the DA
		value that lies under the cursor on the outer disc visible through the window.
		Be careful not to change the positive or negative sign of the value. Recheck
		the computations to ensure that the discs did not slip.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2636">2.6.3.6 </A><U>Pressure Change.</U> Compute the net
		3-hour amount of change on the basis of station pressure entries in Column 22
		of Part I, by subtraction, to the nearest 0.005 inch Hg.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. If an
		observation was not taken 3 hours earlier, consider the net change as
		undeterminable (missing), otherwise determine if the current station pressure
		is higher than, the same as, or lower than 3 hours ago.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(AG) b. If a
		barograph is available, determine the characteristic of the pressure change by
		observing the trace on the barograph chart and select the condition which best
		describes the pattern corresponding to the barograph trace during the past 3
		hours. Disregard minor irregularities. Use the latter part of a trace,
		consistent with the direction of change, when the pattern contains
		representations of two characteristics. See Figure II-6-3 for barograph trace
		comparison for determining pressure characteristics.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2637">2.6.3.7</A> <U>Barometer Calibration.</U> Periodic
		barometer calibration is required, but should never exceed one year from the
		last calibration. An ideal time to schedule barometer calibration services is
		prior to an extended deployment. Contact the nearest NAVMETOCCOM activity to
		receive assistance with calibrating barometers.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="ag264">(AG)2.6.4</A> <U>Barograph Operation.</U> Operate and
		use the barograph as necessary for determination of pressure tendency and as a
		backup to the ML-448/UM for routine pressure measurements. Make adjustments for
		pressure and time errors during periods in which the barograph is in use for
		routine station pressure observations and as otherwise necessary for local
		purposes.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="ag2641">(AG)2.6.4.1</A> <U>Pressure Adjustment.</U> To adjust
		the position of the pen, turn the knurled pressure-adjusting knob at the top of
		the cylindrical pressure-element housing until the pen is at the correct
		station pressure. Tap the case or chassis lightly to overcome any sticking in
		the linkage mechanism before checking the adjustment of the pen. Adjust the
		barograph to a zero correction as specified below at 6 hourly synoptic
		hours.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Readjust
		the barograph to a zero correction when a comparison with the ML-448/UM reveals
		a difference exceeding 1.5 hPa (0.050 inch Hg); i.e., based on the difference
		between the observed barograph reading and station pressure from the aneroid
		barometer. Also readjust the barograph to a zero correction when the chart is
		changed and the correction exceeds 0.3 hPa (0.010 inch Hg). Following any
		readjustment, lightly tap the top of the instrument and recheck the setting in
		order to be certain the barograph has been accurately adjusted to a zero
		correction.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Monitor
		the barograph for any indications of unreliable performance. The corrections
		can be expected to remain essentially constant and should not normally change
		more than 0.3 hPa (0.010 inch Hg) from the preceding 6-hourly comparison.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		If the difference between the current and previous correction exceeds 0.5 hPa
		(0.015 inch Hg), verify the accuracy by making a second comparison.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Take whatever other action is deemed appropriate based on knowledge of past
		instrument performance, diurnal conditions, etc. If the difference between
		corrections tends to be persistently great or to increase rapidly, the
		instrument may be defective and require replacement.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="ag2642">(AG)2.6.4.2</A> <U>Time Adjustment.</U> To adjust the
		cylinder for time, turn it counterclockwise until all slack motion in the drive
		mechanism is removed. If the pen position does not bear the proper relationship
		to the time-ordinate lines after the slack has been removed, continue to turn
		the cylinder counterclockwise with sufficient force to override the friction
		drive until the timing error is eliminated. When in use as the primary pressure
		instrument, adjust the barograph chart for time error if the record trace is in
		error by more than 1/4 of a chart division (15 minutes). When the instrument is
		in use for routine pressure observations, make a time check on the barograph
		immediately after the six-hourly correction has been determined. The line
		should be about equal in length to the width of two divisions on the chart and
		should be made carefully to avoid injury to the mechanism. Do not make a
		time-check line when the instrument is so cold that the pen might not readily
		return to the original position (i.e., due to increased viscosity of the fluid
		in the damper of the dashpot). Do not make a time check for aircraft mishap
		Local observations; i.e., do not disturb the pressure trace for this
		purpose.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="ag2643">(AG)2.6.4.3</A> <U>Chart Scale Adjustment and
		Change.</U> Monitor the barograph during routine operation to ascertain that
		the clock is running and the ink is flowing properly, and note the position of
		the pen on the chart. Whenever it appears that the pen will pass off the
		printed divisions of the chart, set the pen up or down equivalent to one full
		inch of pressure by means of the adjusting screw, and renumber the pressure
		lines accordingly. The barograph chart must be changed to begin a new trace at
		four-day intervals. Change charts on the first day of each month, then every
		fourth day during the month. The following instructions summarize steps to be
		taken when a chart is changed.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Enter the
		beginning date and time at the start of each separate trace on the chart.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Change
		charts at 1200 UTC.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		To replace a chart, remove the pen from the chart by means of the pen shifting
		level and open the case. Lift the cylinder vertically until it is free of the
		spindle and remove the chart from the cylinder. (Avoid storing or handling the
		chart in a manner that might smear the trace before it is dry.) Fit the
		replacement chart smoothly and tightly on the cylinder, with the bottom edge of
		the chart uniformly in contact with the flange at the bottom of the cylinder,
		and replace the clip. Inaccurately cut charts should be trimmed along a line
		parallel to and 1/4 inch (or 5mm) below the lower, horizontal boundary
		ordinate.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Wind the clock mechanism in conjunction with the changing of the chart. The
		mechanism requires 7-8 half-turns for a 4-day interval between windings (or 5-6
		half-turns for a 3-day interval). After winding the clock, lower the cylinder
		gently over the center spindle until the gears have fully meshed, holding the
		cylinder at the top and bottom to avoid disturbing the position of the chart.
		Fill the pen with ink and return it to the surface of the chart, adjusting it,
		if necessary, for pressure and time. Check the pen and clock mechanisms to
		ensure they are functioning.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="265">2.6.5</A> <U>Column 22a, Sea-Level Pressure.</U> Enter the
		sea-level pressure in hectopascals using tens, units, and tenths (without the
