		Columns 10 and 17 SKY CONDITION</B></U> </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-1">2.3.1</A> <U>Introduction</U>. This section contains
		instructions on observing the condition of the sky and making entries on CNMOC
		3141/3 form, Columns 10 and 17. Instructions and code tables for encoding sky
		condition in the synoptic report are contained in
		<A HREF="../../sec-3/text/sec3toc.htm">Section III</A>.</P> 
	 <P>The sky condition consists of clouds and obscurations (aloft and at the
		surface), type, amount of coverage (total and individual layer), and height of
		each layer above the sea surface.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-2">2.3.2</A> <U>Type of Clouds</U></P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Clouds
		are divided into three levels; low, middle, and high, based on height. There
		are basically two forms of clouds, stratiform and cumuliform. These levels
		appear at different heights in different latitude regions.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		Stratiform clouds consist of low clouds (stratus, stratocumulus), mid clouds
		(altostratus and nimbostratus) and high clouds (cirrostratus).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Cumuliform clouds consist of low clouds (cumulus, cumulonimbus, stratocumulus)
		mid clouds (altocumulus) and high clouds (cirrocumulus). Stratocumulus has
		characteristics of both stratus and cumulus clouds. Cirrus, a high cloud, does
		not fit into either form.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-3">2.3.3</A> <U>Obscurations</U>. Obscurations can either
		be aloft or at the surface. Definitions of obscurations are covered in
		<A HREF="sec2ch5.htm">Section II, Chapter 5</A>. Types of obscurations are
		listed in <A HREF="#fig2-3-1">Figure II-3.1</A>. Any layer of obscurations
		aloft which covers 1/8 or more of the sky is considered in sky condition.
		Surface based obscurations and those within 50 feet of the surface which are
		obscuring 1/8 or more of the sky, are also reported as in sky condition with a
		height of 000.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-3-1">2.3.3.1</A> <U>Obscurations Aloft</U>. Includes haze,
		dust, and smoke. Hydrometers (liquid or frozen water particles falling through
		or suspended in the atmosphere) are never classified as obscurations aloft.
		Precipitation falling from a cloud but not reaching the surface (virga) is
		considered as part of the cloud the precipitation is falling from.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-3-2">2.3.3.2</A> <U>Surface Based Obscurations</U>.
		Includes fog, haze, dust, blowing dust, sand, snow, and spray. Precipitation
		reaching the surface often obstructs part of the sky. When fog lifts
		(dissipates at the surface) leaving a low layer of clouds such as stratus
		fractus, the layer is a cloud, not fog aloft.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-4">2.3.4</A> <U>Observing Cloud/Obscuration Type</U>. The
		type of cloud or obscuration is determined visually by using
		<A HREF="#fig2-3-2">Figure II-3.2</A> and <A HREF="#tab2-3-2">Tables II-3-2</A>
		and <A HREF="#tab2-3-8">II-3-8</A>, or through the observer's experience. Once
		the form of the cloud is determined (Stratiform or Cumuliform), the height of
		the cloud will determine the type (low, middle (Alto) or high (cirro)). Most of
		the small, well-defined and regularly arranged elements of Altocumulus will
		usually have an apparent width between one and five degrees (disregarding
		detached elements generally seen on the edges). The cloud is generally
		considered as Stratocumulus if the width of elements is greater than five
		degrees, and as Cirrocumulus, if the width is less than one degree. When the
		arm is held extended, one and five degrees are approximately the width of the
		little finger and the width of three fingers, respectively.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-5">2.3.5</A> <U>Sky Cover Amounts</U>. Sky cover amounts
		are determined for the following:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Total
		sky, covered by all obscurations and all clouds. This total is placed in Column
		17.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Total
		sky, covered by all clouds for inclusion in the ship synoptic code as N. Ignore
		obscurations aloft and surface based obscurations that do not cover a full 8/8
		of the sky.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Layer
		amounts using the Summation Principle. The amount of the lowest layer to the
		nearest 1/8 sky cover. The summation amounts of the layers above the lowest
		layer are determined for each layer present. The summation amount of the second
		layer is the amount of the lowest layer plus the amount of the second layer
		that is visible. Each successively higher layer is totaled by adding the
		summation total of the layer below it, plus the amount of that layer that is
		visible. No layer can be assigned a sky cover less than a lower layer, and no
		sky cover can be greater than 8/8.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A
		NAME="2-3-5_1">(1)</A> The summation layer amount is determined for each layer
		present in column 10.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		The summation total of all low clouds (the summation amount of the highest
		layer of low clouds) is determined for inclusion as Nh in the ship synoptic
		code. If no low clouds are present, this will be the summation total of all
		middle clouds (the summation amount of the highest layer of middle clouds).</P>
	 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-5-1">2.3.5.1</A> <U>Determining Sky Cover Amounts</U>.
		Estimate the amount of sky cover on the basis of experience and using the
		following methods as a guide.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. In order
		to develop experience in determining sky cover amounts, mentally divide the sky
		into halves or quarters and estimate the amounts in each section. The sections
		should be selected to suit the prevailing sky condition, and the amount of each
		layer is estimated by supposing the clouds present in the layer to be brought
		together into a continuous sheet.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. During
		darkness, consider the sky to be clear if stars are plainly visible in all
		sections and no cloud or obscuration is observed. When the stars are dimmed,
		the dimming is evidence of the presence of cloud or obscuration and will be of
		assistance in determining the amount and opacity of the layer. Reflection (sky
		glow) from a city or other lights may be useful in estimating the amount of low
		cloud layers.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. To
		estimate the amount of an advancing (or receding) layer, determine the angular
		elevation above the horizon of the forward or rear edge of the layer as seen
		against the sky. If available, use a theodolite or clinometer to help gain
		experience in estimating vertical angles. Convert the angle to a sky cover
		amount using <A HREF="#tab2-3-1">Table II-3-1</A>. When the layer does not
		extend to the horizon, determine the angular elevation of the forward and rear
		edges and the tenths of sky cover corresponding to each elevation angle. The
		difference will equal the actual sky cover. For example:</P>

		  </TBODY> 
		</TABLE></CENTER> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. When a
		continuous layer surrounds the station and extends to the horizon, determine
		the angular elevation of the edge, and convert it to a sky cover amount using
		<A HREF="#tab2-3-1">Table II-3-1</A>. This method is most useful in determining
		the amount of sky hidden for a partly obscured condition. For clouds, such a
		distribution is very infrequent and the tables serve only as a guide in
		estimating amounts during situations that approach this configuration.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. In sky
		cover evaluations, cumuliform clouds tend to produce a "packing effect" when
		the sides and tops are visible, appearing more numerous toward the horizon. Do
		not make allowance for the packing effect in determining sky cover amounts.
		Estimate the layer sky cover on the basis of the amount of sky actually covered
		including the sky covered by both the base and sides of the clouds).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.
		Interconnection of Layers. When clouds formed by the horizontal extension of
		swelling Cumulus or Cumulonimbus are attached to a parent cloud, they are
		regarded as a separate layer only if their bases appear horizontal and at a
		different level than the base of the parent cloud. Otherwise, the entire cloud
		system is regarded as a single layer at a height corresponding to that of the
		base of the parent cloud.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-5-2">2.3.5.2</A> <U>Evaluation of Sky Cover Amounts</U>.
		Evaluate sky cover amounts as follows, beginning with the lowest layer and
		proceeding in ascending order of height. All clouds are considered opaque.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Estimate
		the amount of sky cover for the lowest layer present. Remarks elaborating on
		surface-based partial obscurations follow the format and order of entry for
		obscurations aloft, but are assigned a height of "000" (i.e., FG FEW000).
		Consider a trace of cloud as 1/8th when it is the lowest layer.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. For each
		additional layer of sky cover present above the lowest layer, estimate the
		amount of sky cover for the individual layer summation sky cover, and the
		summation total sky cover.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-5-3">2.3.5.3</A> <U>Sky Cover Classifications for Ship
		Observations</U>. The terms used to reflect the degree of cloudiness or sky
		coverage in sky condition evaluations.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <U>Sky
		Clear</U> (SKC). An abbreviation used to describe the absence of layers of
		clouds or other obscurations.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		<U>Few</U> (FEW). A sky cover of 1/8 to 2/8, based on a summation of sky cover
		at and below the level of a layer aloft.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.
		<U>Scattered</U> (SCT). A sky cover of 3/8 through 4/8, based on a summation of

	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.
		<U>Broken</U> (BKN). A sky cover of 5/8 through less than 8/8 based on a
		summation of sky cover at and below the level of a layer aloft. More than 7/8
		but less than 8/8 is considered as 7/8 for reporting purposes. </P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.
		<U>Overcast</U> (OVC). A sky cover of 8/8 based on a summation of sky cover at

	 <P><A NAME="2-3-5-4">2.3.5.4</A> <U>Determination of Ceiling Layer.</U> In
		conjunction with the determination of sky cover amounts, evaluate the sky
		condition for the existence of a ceiling. The ceiling is defined as the height
		ascribed to the lowest broken or overcast layer, or the vertical visibility
		into surface-based obscuration. Surface based obscurations can have their
		heights determined by the following methods:</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The
		height of visible portions of nearby ships or land mass of known height.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The
		vertical distance the observer can see upward into an obscuration, based on
		experience and visual estimates when other guidelines are not available or are
		considered unreliable.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The top
		of a ceiling light beam, or the height at which a balloon completely
		disappears.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. The
		maximum vertical height above the sea within 15 minutes of the actual time of
		observation at which a pilot can discern the surface. The height value should
		not be used if, in the judgment of the observer, it is not representative of
		conditions over the ship.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-6">2.3.6</A> <U>Determination of Layer Heights</U>.
		Determine the height for each layer aloft and for the vertical visibility into
		surface based obscurations which totally obscures the sky. A height value is
		not determined for a partly obscured layer. Use the most accurate and reliable
		method available (ceiling light, balloon, pilot report, etc.). Determine height
		data in feet above the sea surface to the nearest reportable value as specified
		in <A HREF="#tab2-3-2">Table II-3-2</A>.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-6-1">2.3.6.1</A> <U>Ceiling Light Evaluations</U>. If
		available for use, the following instructions summarize procedures for use of a
		ceiling light projector and clinometer in determining height data at night.</P>
	 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Stand at
		the established point of observation for the baseline in use. For a layer
		aloft, note the location of the lowest portion of the spot of light on the base
		of the layer (the remainder of the spot or beam of light represents penetration
		of the layer). For a surface-based layer, the apparent top of the beam of light
		may serve as a guide in estimating vertical visibility. Multiple layers may be
		noticeable by the appearance of two or more spots at different levels.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Allow the
		clinometer pendant to swing freely, and sight through the clinometer. Center
		the intersection of the cross-hair on the brightest portion of the light beam
		spot (for a layer aloft) or on the upper limit of the light beam penetration
		(for a totally obscured condition).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. When the
		pendant has come to rest, lock it in position without moving the
		clinometer.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Read the
		indicated angle to at least the nearest whole degree and release the pendant
		clutch.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Obtain a
		minimum of three angular readings and determine the average.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. Refer to
		the table appropriate for the baseline used and determine the equivalent height
		value for the average angular reading.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-6-2">2.3.6.2</A> <U>Preparation of Sky Cover Height
		Tables</U>. For a ceiling light, using <A HREF="#tab2-3-3">Table II-3-3</A> as
		a guide, prepare tables of elevation angles and equivalent height values for
		each baseline established for use. Include appropriate identification data for
		subsequent reference purposes; i.e., length of baseline and ceiling light
		elevation above the sea surface.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Compute
		tabular values for ceiling light baselines on the basis of h = (b) (tan - );
		where 'b' is the baseline, " - " is the angular reading, and "h" is the sky
		cover height value. (See <A HREF="#tab2-3-3">Table II-3-3</A> for angles and
		the respective tangents).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		Algebraically add the difference between the height of the observation site and
		sea level to each tabular value.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Round
		each of the sums to the nearest reportable height increment contained in
		<A HREF="#tab2-3-2">Table II-3-2</A>.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-6-3">2.3.6.3</A> <U>Balloon Height Evaluations</U>. On
		ships equipped for balloon inflation, ceiling or pilot balloons can often be
		utilized to obtain sky cover height data when the ceiling height is estimated
		or known to be 2,000 feet or less and the presence of Nimbostratus or other
		stratiform cloud layers makes estimation difficult.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Release
		balloons at a frequency dictated by operational need and consistent with
		changes in ceiling height which have occurred since the last ceiling
		determination was made, particularly in relation to special and local
		observation criteria.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The
		following instructions summarize the steps involved in obtaining balloon height
		estimates.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		Choose the appropriate color of balloon. Red balloons are usually preferable
		with thin clouds; blue or black balloons should be used under other
		conditions.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Watch the balloon continuously and determine, with a stop watch (or any watch
		having a second hand), the length of time that elapses between release of the
		balloon and entry into the base of the layer. Consider the point of entry as
		midway between the time the balloon first begins to fade and the time of
		complete disappearance for layers aloft. Use the point at which the balloon
		disappeared as a guide in estimating the vertical visibility in a totally
		obscured condition.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		Using <A HREF="#tab2-3-4">Table II-3-4</A> (or a locally prepared table),
		determine the height above the point of observation corresponding to the
		nearest 5 seconds of elapsed ascent time.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
		Algebraically add to the tabular value the difference between the height of the
		observation site and the sea surface, and round off the result to the nearest
		reportable height increment. (NOTE: This step is not applicable to locally
		prepared tables in which the tabular values have been corrected for the
		difference in elevation).</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The
		relative accuracy of height data obtained by balloon may be adversely affected
		by conditions such as those indicated below and, therefore, data must be used
		with caution.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
		The balloon rate of ascent is significantly reduced by rain and wet snow, hail,
		ice pellets, and freezing rain, and at night when a light is attached.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
		Strong winds with poor horizontal visibility may result in too low an
		indication of height. The large horizontal movement of the balloon in flight
		and the reduced visibility may make it appear that the balloon entered the
		cloud before it actually did so. </P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
		Entry into an unrepresentative portion of the cloud base, or through a break in
		the layer, may result in inaccurate height evaluations. If time allows, another
		balloon should be released in an attempt to hit the cloud base.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="2-3-6-4">2.3.6.4</A> <U>Estimation of Cloud Heights</U>. When
		cloud heights cannot be determined by ceiling light, ceiling balloon or pilot
		report, they must be visually estimated using the experience of the observer,
		following the guides below.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The
		apparent size of cloud elements, rolls or features visible in the layer. Large
		rolls or elements usually indicate that the layer is relatively low while small
		rolls or elements usually indicate that the layer is relatively high.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.
		Reflection of city or other lights at night may serve not only to indicate the
		presence of a layer but may be useful as a guide in estimating its height.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.
		Persistence of a layer height previously classified as measured will aid in
		estimation and build observer confidence in estimations.</P> 
	 <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Use
		<A HREF="#tab2-3-5">Table II-3-5</A> to aid in estimating the height of new
		forming cumulus. This table uses the difference between the air temperature and
		the dew point temperature. The table assumes the cumulus is being formed by
		active surface convection in the vicinity of the ship (not frontal activity).
		The table should not be used when the surface temperature is below freezing due
		to the difficulties inherent in the accurate determination of the dew point at
		low temperatures.</P>

		1/8 (and for a trace of cloud), "7" for 7/8 or more but less than 8/8. When
		referencing sky cover amount contractions use "0" for SKC, "2" for FEW, "4" for
		SCT, "6" for BKN, and "8" for OVC.</P>
